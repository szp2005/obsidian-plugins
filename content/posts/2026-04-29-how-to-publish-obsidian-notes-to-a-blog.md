# How to Publish Obsidian Notes to a Blog: Every Method Compared (2024)

---

## TL;DR

- **Obsidian Publish** costs $8–$16/month and takes 10 minutes to set up — worth it if you want zero friction and don't mind paying.
- **Quartz + GitHub Pages** is the best free option: built specifically for Obsidian vaults, handles wikilinks natively, and deploys automatically.
- **Hugo and Astro** give you full design control but require real technical effort — pick them only if customization matters more than speed-to-launch.

## 1. Why Turn Your Obsidian Vault into a Public Blog? {#why}

Your Obsidian vault is already a structured, interlinked body of knowledge. Publishing it doesn't mean copying files into WordPress — it means exposing what you already built to people who need it.

**The digital garden model** is different from a traditional blog. You don't wait until an article is "finished." Notes stay in permanent draft mode, growing as you learn. Readers see your thinking evolve in real time. It's honest, and — practically speaking — it means you can publish more often with less anxiety.

Beyond the philosophy, the practical case is strong:

- **Personal brand.** A public knowledge base ranks in search engines, gets linked, and demonstrates competence better than a resume.
- **Learning in public.** Readers correct your mistakes, offer counterexamples, and point you toward papers you missed. The feedback loop makes your notes better.
- **Single source of truth.** When your Obsidian vault IS your blog, you write once. No copy-pasting between apps, no format drift.

The only question is which publishing path fits your situation. That's exactly what this guide answers.

## 2. Method 1: The Official Way with Obsidian Publish {#obsidian-publish}

[Obsidian Publish](URL_PLACEHOLDER_1) is the built-in, first-party publishing service. You pay a subscription, choose which notes go live, and Obsidian handles the rest.

### How It Works

Inside Obsidian, open any note and click the Publish icon (paper-plane icon in the left sidebar). You get a diff view showing which notes are unpublished, modified, or already live. Click the notes you want, hit Publish, and they appear at `your-site.obsidian.site` within seconds.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. Go to **Settings → Core Plugins → Obsidian Publish** and enable it.
2. Open the Publish panel (Ctrl/Cmd + P → "Publish changes").
3. Create a new site and choose a subdomain.
4. Select the notes you want public and click **Publish**.
5. Optionally: configure a custom domain in the Publish settings panel.

### Pricing

- **$8/month** (billed annually) for a personal site.
- **$16/month** if billed monthly.

### Pros

- Zero technical overhead — works inside Obsidian with one click.
- Wikilinks, backlinks, and graph view work automatically.
- Selective publishing: your private notes stay private by default.
- Obsidian handles SSL, CDN, and mobile-responsive layout.

### Cons

- Ongoing cost forever. A year costs $96–$192.
- Limited customization: you can add custom CSS but cannot change the site's core structure.
- No plugins, no custom JavaScript logic.
- Basic SEO controls — no server-side rendering, limited meta tag control.

**Bottom line:** Obsidian Publish is the right choice if you value time over money and have no interest in touching code. If you publish fewer than 50 notes and just want it done, this is your answer.

---

## 3. Method 2: Free Static Site Generators {#ssg-overview}

A static site generator (SSG) takes your Markdown files and converts them into plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Because Obsidian notes are already Markdown, SSGs are a natural fit.

The general workflow looks like this:

```
Obsidian Vault → Git Repository → SSG Build Step → Static HTML → Hosted on CDN
```

You write in Obsidian. A push to GitHub triggers an automated build. The SSG parses your Markdown, resolves links, applies a theme, and outputs a folder of HTML files. A hosting platform like [Netlify](URL_PLACEHOLDER_2) or [Vercel](URL_PLACEHOLDER_3) deploys that folder globally in seconds — both offer genuinely free tiers that handle serious traffic.

**Key advantages over Obsidian Publish:**

- **Free hosting** on Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
- **Full design control** — change every pixel.
- **Better SEO** — server-rendered HTML, full control over meta tags, sitemaps, and canonical URLs.
- **No vendor lock-in** — your notes stay as Markdown files.

The trade-off is setup time. Budget 1–3 hours for Quartz, 4–8 hours for Hugo or Astro if you're new to them.

---

## 4. Deep Dive: Comparing the Best SSGs for Obsidian {#ssg-comparison}

### Quartz

[Quartz](URL_PLACEHOLDER_4) is built specifically for Obsidian vaults. It handles `[[wikilinks]]` natively, renders backlinks, and generates an interactive graph view — all without configuration. If you know how to use Git, you can have a live site in under an hour.

### Hugo

Hugo is the fastest SSG available. Build times for a 1,000-page site run under 1 second. It has a mature plugin ecosystem, excellent SEO support, and hundreds of themes. The learning curve is real — Hugo's templating language (Go templates) is unintuitive at first. The [Obsidian-to-Hugo](URL_PLACEHOLDER_5) plugin and community themes like PaperMod make the integration smoother.

### Astro

Astro is a modern framework that ships zero JavaScript by default, meaning your pages load fast. It supports React, Vue, and Svelte components inside Markdown files, so you can add interactive features later. A dedicated Obsidian-Astro integration exists on FreeCodeCamp. It's the best pick if you're a developer who wants a blog that can grow into a full web app.

### Jekyll

Jekyll is the oldest player. GitHub Pages runs Jekyll natively — push a repo with a `_config.yml` and your site is live with no build pipeline needed. The downside: `[[wikilinks]]` don't convert natively. You need the `jekyll-wikilinks` plugin, and the ecosystem hasn't kept pace with newer tools.

## 5. Step-by-Step: Publish Your Vault with Quartz and GitHub Pages {#quartz-tutorial}

This is the fastest path from zero to a live digital garden. Prerequisites: a GitHub account and Git installed locally.

### Step 1: Fork and Clone Quartz

Go to the [Quartz GitHub repository](URL_PLACEHOLDER_6) and click **Fork**. Then clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quartz.git
cd quartz
npm install
```

### Step 2: Add Your Notes

Copy your Obsidian notes into the `/content` directory. Keep your folder structure — Quartz preserves it as URL paths. Your vault's `index.md` becomes the homepage.

```bash
cp -r ~/path/to/your/vault/* ./content/
```

### Step 3: Configure Quartz

Edit `quartz.config.ts` in the root directory:

```typescript
const config: QuartzConfig = {
  configuration: {
    pageTitle: "Your Site Name",
    baseUrl: "your-username.github.io/quartz",
    // Change to your GitHub Pages URL or custom domain
  },
}
```

Set `ignorePatterns` to exclude any folders you want private:

```typescript
ignorePatterns: ["private", "templates", ".obsidian"],
```

### Step 4: Build and Preview Locally

```bash
npx quartz build --serve
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`. Verify wikilinks resolve correctly and graph view works.

### Step 5: Push and Deploy via GitHub Pages

Quartz includes a pre-built GitHub Actions workflow. Push your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial vault publish"
git push origin main
```

In your GitHub repository settings:
- Go to **Settings → Pages**.
- Set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
- The workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` handles the rest.

Within 2–3 minutes, your site is live at `https://your-username.github.io/quartz`.

### Step 6: Set Up a Custom Domain (Optional)

Purchase a domain from [Namecheap](URL_PLACEHOLDER_7). In your domain's DNS settings, add:

```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: your-username.github.io
```

Add a `CNAME` file to your `/content` directory containing just your domain (`www.yourdomain.com`). Update `baseUrl` in `quartz.config.ts` to match.

## 6. Don't Forget SEO: Optimizing Your Published Notes {#seo}

Publishing notes without SEO attention wastes the traffic potential. Here's a concrete checklist.

### YAML Frontmatter Is Your Meta Layer

Every note you publish should have a frontmatter block:

```yaml
---
title: "How Spaced Repetition Rewired My Study Habits"
author: "Alex Chen"
description: "A practical breakdown of how I use Anki and Obsidian together to retain 90% of what I read."
date: 2024-03-15
tags: [learning, memory, obsidian]
slug: spaced-repetition-obsidian-study
draft: false
---
```

- `title` becomes the `<title>` tag and H1. Write it for humans first, include your keyword naturally.
- `description` becomes the meta description. Keep it under 155 characters.
- `slug` sets your URL. Use lowercase, hyphens, no special characters. Quartz, Hugo, and Astro all respect this field.
- `draft: true` on any note you want built but not indexed — add a `noindex` rule in your SSG config.

### Wikilinks and URL Structure

The biggest technical SEO risk when publishing Obsidian notes is broken internal links. `[[Note Title]]` wikilinks need to become `<a href="/note-title">` in HTML.

- **Quartz** handles this automatically.
- **Hugo**: Use the `hugo-obsidian` preprocessor tool to convert wikilinks before build.
- **Astro**: The `remark-wiki-link` plugin handles conversion in `astro.config.mjs`.
- **Jekyll**: Install the `jekyll-wikilinks` gem and add it to `_config.yml`.

Audit your internal links after every major restructure. A broken internal link not only hurts UX — it bleeds PageRank.

### Sitemap and Robots

Quartz generates a `sitemap.xml` automatically. For Hugo, set `enableRobotsTXT = true` and `sitemap.changefreq = "weekly"` in `hugo.toml`. Submit the sitemap URL to Google Search Console within the first week of launch.

### Clean URL Slugs

Avoid publishing notes with titles like "202401 meeting notes spaced rep v3 FINAL." Before a note goes public, rename it properly. The note filename is the default slug in most SSGs. A slug like `spaced-repetition-study-method` beats `202401-meeting-notes-spaced-rep-v3-FINAL` on every metric.

---

## 7. Automating Deployment with GitHub Actions {#automation}

If you use Quartz, the deployment workflow is already included. But if you're on Hugo or a custom setup, here's a complete, copy-paste GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: true
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v3
        with:
          hugo-version: "latest"
          extended: true

      - name: Build site
        run: hugo --minify

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./public
```

**How this works:** Every time you push a commit to `main` — whether that's a new note, an edit, or a config change — GitHub spins up a fresh Ubuntu container, installs Hugo, builds your site, and deploys the output to the `gh-pages` branch. Your site is updated within 60–90 seconds of your push.

To trigger this from your daily Obsidian workflow without touching a terminal: use the [Obsidian Git plugin](URL_PLACEHOLDER_8). Configure it to auto-commit and push on a schedule (every 15 minutes, or on Obsidian close). Notes you mark `draft: false` in frontmatter go live automatically.

For advanced setups requiring more compute or custom server logic, consider [DigitalOcean App Platform](URL_PLACEHOLDER_9) — their basic tier handles static sites and gives you more control over build environments than GitHub Pages.

### Decision Framework by Persona

**The Beginner** — You've been using Obsidian for 3 months and want to start sharing notes but have never used Git. **Use Obsidian Publish.** Pay the $8/month, spend the time learning what and how you want to publish, then migrate to Quartz when you outgrow it.

**The Tinkerer** — You know what Git is, you've edited a config file before, and free matters to you. **Use Quartz.** It's purpose-built for your workflow, the docs are solid, and the community is active. You'll be live today.

**The Pro** — You want a site that could become a full product: newsletter integration, custom page types, fast search, unique design. **Use Astro on [Netlify](URL_PLACEHOLDER_10) or Hugo on [Vercel](URL_PLACEHOLDER_11).** It's more work upfront, but you won't hit a ceiling.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Publishing your Obsidian notes isn't a complicated problem — it's a decision problem. The tools all work. The question is what you're optimizing for.

If you want to be live **today** with no headaches, open your wallet and use [Obsidian Publish](URL_PLACEHOLDER_12). If you want **free, automatic, and ownership-first**, fork Quartz, spend an hour on setup, and push your first commit. If you want a site that can grow into something genuinely custom, start with [Astro on Netlify](URL_PLACEHOLDER_13) and commit the time to learn the tooling.

The worst decision is waiting until your notes are "good enough." They never will be by that standard. Pick a method, get something live this week, and iterate in public.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I keep some notes private when publishing?

Yes, with all methods. Obsidian Publish only publishes notes you explicitly select. With SSGs, use `draft: true` in frontmatter, put private notes in an ignored folder (defined in your SSG config or `.gitignore`), or maintain a separate "public" subfolder in your vault.

### Will my `[[wikilinks]]` break when published?

They will unless you handle the conversion. Quartz converts them automatically. For Hugo, use the `hugo-obsidian` CLI tool as a pre-processing step. For Astro, install `remark-wiki-link`. For Jekyll, use the `jekyll-wikilinks` gem. Run a local build and audit all links before going live.

### How do I handle images and attachments from my vault?

Copy your attachments folder into your SSG's content or static directory. In Quartz, place images in `/content` alongside your notes. Update any image paths in frontmatter or note bodies if your folder structure changes. Obsidian Publish handles attachments automatically.

### Is Obsidian Publish worth the cost if I only have 20 notes?

Probably yes, for the first six months. The friction saved is worth $8/month while you're figuring out your publishing workflow. Once you have a consistent habit and more content, evaluate the SSG migration.

### How do I migrate from Obsidian Publish to Quartz later?

Your notes are already in Markdown — that's the hard part done. Export or copy your vault's Markdown files into Quartz's `/content` directory, run the build, and check for broken links. The main adjustment is updating any Obsidian Publish-specific settings in your frontmatter and configuring your new custom domain DNS.

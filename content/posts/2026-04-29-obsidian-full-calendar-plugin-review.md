# Obsidian Full Calendar Plugin Review: Complete Setup Guide & Workflows (2024)

**TL;DR**
- Full Calendar transforms Obsidian into a genuine productivity hub by rendering interactive calendar views from local notes, Google Calendar, and CalDAV sources inside your vault.
- Setup takes under 10 minutes for basic use; Google Calendar and CalDAV sync require a bit more work but the payoff is a single pane of glass for all your scheduling.
- It beats every alternative for users who want external calendar sync—but it has real-world quirks you need to know before committing to it.

## What Is the Obsidian Full Calendar Plugin? {#what-is}

Most knowledge workers live in two separate worlds: a note-taking app for thinking and a calendar app for scheduling. The result is constant context-switching—you reference your meeting notes in Obsidian, then flip to Google Calendar to check a time, then back again. Every switch costs you focus.

The [Obsidian Full Calendar plugin](URL_PLACEHOLDER_1), built by developer Davis Haupt (`davish`), collapses those two worlds into one. It renders a full FullCalendar.js-powered interface—month, week, and day views—directly inside an Obsidian pane, treating markdown notes as calendar events. Events live as `.md` files in your vault or sync in from external sources like Google Calendar and any CalDAV-compatible service.

This is meaningfully different from the stock [Obsidian Calendar plugin](URL_PLACEHOLDER_2), which only lets you navigate daily notes chronologically. Full Calendar lets you *schedule* things, drag events across time, and pull live data from the calendars you already use.

**Who gets the most out of it:**
- **Students** tracking assignment deadlines, exam blocks, and study sessions
- **Content creators** running an editorial calendar with draft → publish pipelines
- **Professionals** who live in meetings and want context-rich notes linked directly to each event

If you have ever wished your PKM system could double as a planner without leaving the app—this is your plugin. If you want to deepen the productivity methodology behind a setup like this, [Getting Things Done by David Allen](URL_PLACEHOLDER_3) is still the clearest framework for understanding how to structure your capture and review cycles.

## Installation and First-Time Setup: A 5-Minute Guide {#installation}

### Step 1: Install from Community Plugins

1. Open Obsidian → **Settings** → **Community Plugins**
2. Disable Safe Mode if prompted
3. Click **Browse**, search `Full Calendar`
4. Click **Install** then **Enable**

### Step 2: Open the Plugin Settings

Navigate to **Settings → Full Calendar**. You'll see a "Calendar Sources" section. This is the single most important configuration screen—everything the calendar displays comes from here.

### Step 3: Add Your First Local Calendar Source

Click **Add Calendar Source** → choose **Local**. Point it at a folder in your vault (e.g., `Calendar/Events`). This is where new events will be written as markdown files. Set a display color (hex or picker). Click **Save**.

### Step 4: Create Your First Event

Open the Full Calendar view via the left ribbon icon (a small calendar icon). Click any time slot on the grid. A modal appears asking for:
- **Title** (required)
- **Date and time**
- **All-day toggle**
- **Calendar source** (the local folder you just created)

Hit **Save**. Obsidian immediately creates a `.md` file in your chosen folder with frontmatter like:

```yaml
---
title: Team standup
author: "Alex Chen"
date: 2024-08-15
startTime: "09:00"
endTime: "09:30"
type: event
---
```

That note is now a calendar event. Edit the frontmatter directly or drag the event block on the calendar grid to reschedule it.

### Step 5: Understand the Views

- **Month view**: High-level planning, ideal for spotting deadline clusters
- **Week view**: Most useful for day-to-day scheduling and time blocking
- **Day view**: Detailed hourly breakdown; pairs well with time blocking techniques

Switch views using the buttons in the top-right corner of the calendar pane.

## Deep Dive: Mastering Core Features {#core-features}

### Events from Frontmatter

Any existing note becomes a calendar event if you add the correct frontmatter. This is powerful for retroactively scheduling things. Add `date`, `startTime`, and `endTime` to a note and it appears on the calendar automatically—no duplication, no separate entry.

### Drag-and-Drop Rescheduling

Click and hold any event block, then drag it to a new slot. The plugin rewrites the frontmatter `date` and time fields automatically. This makes weekly reviews fast: drag overdue tasks to new time slots in seconds.

### Color Coding by Source

Each calendar source gets its own color. Use this to visually separate:
- Work commitments (red)
- Personal events (blue)
- Deadlines (orange)
- External synced calendars (green)

You cannot currently color-code by individual tag within a local source—color operates at the source/folder level. If you need per-event colors, organize events into multiple source folders.

### All-Day vs. Timed Events

Toggle the all-day option for deadlines, anniversaries, or multi-day blocks. All-day events float at the top of the week and day views, separate from timed slots, which keeps your hourly grid clean.

## The Ultimate Integration: Syncing with Google Calendar & CalDAV {#sync}

This is where Full Calendar separates itself from every other Obsidian calendar option—and where most setup confusion happens. Follow these steps carefully.

### Google Calendar Sync (Read-Only via iCal URL)

Full Calendar currently connects to Google Calendar via a **public iCal URL**. This is read-only—events flow from Google into Obsidian, not the other way.

1. Open [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) → find your calendar in the left sidebar
2. Click the three-dot menu → **Settings and sharing**
3. Scroll to **Integrate calendar** → copy the **Secret address in iCal format** (the URL starting with `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/...`)
4. In Obsidian: **Settings → Full Calendar → Add Calendar Source → Remote (.ics / iCal URL)**
5. Paste the URL, name it, pick a color, save

Your Google Calendar events now appear in Obsidian. They refresh when you reopen the vault. **Important**: use the "Secret address" (private iCal), not the public one, or private events won't appear.

### CalDAV Sync (Two-Way, Full Read/Write)

For genuine two-way sync—where you can create and edit events from inside Obsidian and have them appear in your external calendar—you need a **CalDAV source**. [Fastmail](URL_PLACEHOLDER_4) is our recommended provider: it's privacy-focused, reliable, and its CalDAV implementation is clean and well-documented.

**Setup steps:**

1. In your CalDAV provider, locate the CalDAV server URL and your calendar's specific URL path
   - **Fastmail**: `https://caldav.fastmail.com/dav/principals/user/you@fastmail.com/`
   - **iCloud**: `https://caldav.icloud.com/`
2. In Obsidian: **Settings → Full Calendar → Add Calendar Source → CalDAV**
3. Enter:
   - **CalDAV server URL** (from step 1)
   - **Username** (usually your email address)
   - **Password** (for iCloud, generate an app-specific password at appleid.apple.com)
4. Click **Find Calendars**—the plugin queries the server and lists available calendars
5. Select which calendar to sync, assign a color, save

Events now flow both directions. Create an event in Obsidian and it appears in Fastmail's web UI (or your phone's calendar app) within seconds.

## 3 Practical Workflows to Organize Your Life {#workflows}

### Workflow 1: The Student Assignment Tracker

**Setup**: Create two local sources—`Deadlines` (red) and `Study Blocks` (blue). Add your university's academic calendar as an iCal URL source.

**How it works**: Each assignment gets a note in `Deadlines` with the due date. Use the week view to see upcoming deadlines, then create Study Block events by clicking open time slots—working backward from the deadline. When you open a Study Block event note, link it directly to your course notes using standard `[[wikilinks]]`. You now have a calendar that opens into your actual study material.

For users who want to build this kind of system more formally, [this productivity course on Skillshare](URL_PLACEHOLDER_5) walks through building a full PKM system from scratch.

### Workflow 2: The Content Creator's Editorial Calendar

**Setup**: One local source folder per content type—`Blog Posts`, `YouTube Scripts`, `Social Media`. Each gets a distinct color.

**How it works**: When you start a new piece, create it as an event with the target publish date. Add a `status` field to frontmatter (`draft`, `review`, `scheduled`, `published`). Use the month view for editorial planning—you can see at a glance whether you're clustering too many posts in one week. Drag events to redistribute. Because each event *is* a note, your full draft lives inside the calendar entry.

### Workflow 3: The Professional's Meeting Dashboard

**Setup**: Sync your work Google Calendar via iCal URL (read-only). Create a local `Meeting Notes` source for Obsidian-created events.

**How it works**: For each meeting that comes from Google Calendar, create a corresponding Meeting Notes event in your local source at the same time. Use a template (via Templater or QuickAdd) that auto-populates agenda, attendees, and action items. The Google Calendar event tells you *when*; the Obsidian event carries all the context. During the week view, both appear in the same time slot, color-coded so you know at a glance which has associated notes.

## Full Calendar vs. The Alternatives {#comparison}

| Feature | Full Calendar | Native Calendar Plugin | Fantasy Calendar |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly/weekly/daily views | ✅ All three | Monthly only | Monthly only |
| Local note events | ✅ | ✅ (daily notes only) | ✅ |
| Google Calendar sync | ✅ (read-only iCal) | ❌ | ❌ |
| CalDAV two-way sync | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Drag-and-drop reschedule | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Fictional/custom calendars | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Active development | ✅ | Slow | Active |
| Setup complexity | Medium | Low | Low |

**When to choose an alternative:**
- **Native Calendar plugin**: You only need daily note navigation, nothing more. Zero configuration.
- **Fantasy Calendar**: You're a worldbuilder or fiction writer who needs custom calendar systems (13-month years, different day lengths). Not for real-world scheduling.
- **Full Calendar**: Every other use case, especially anything involving external sync.

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions {#pitfalls}

**Problem: iCal URL shows no events after adding**
*Cause*: You copied the public calendar URL instead of the secret iCal URL.
*Fix*: Go back to Google Calendar → Settings → "Secret address in iCal format." It includes a long token in the URL. That's the one you need.

**Problem: CalDAV login fails with "401 Unauthorized"**
*Cause*: For iCloud, your Apple ID password won't work. CalDAV requires an app-specific password.
*Fix*: Go to appleid.apple.com → Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords → generate one, use that in the CalDAV field.

**Problem: Events duplicated after editing frontmatter**
*Cause*: You moved the note file to a different folder while it was already tracked.
*Fix*: Don't move event notes manually between source folders. Change the source assignment inside the plugin instead, then let it reconcile.

**Problem: Calendar view is sluggish with large vaults**
*Cause*: The plugin scans all notes in source folders on load. A source folder with hundreds of old events slows things down.
*Fix*: Archive old event notes to a subfolder that is *not* designated as a calendar source. Keep active sources lean (< 200 notes).

**Problem: Sync stops updating after a few days**
*Cause*: iCal URLs can have caching behavior on Obsidian's end.
*Fix*: Close and reopen the vault, or toggle the calendar source off and on in Settings to force a refresh.

## Final Verdict {#verdict}

**Pros:**
- Genuine external calendar sync (the only Obsidian plugin that does this well)
- Events are real notes—linked, searchable, full markdown
- Drag-and-drop reschedule is genuinely fast for weekly reviews
- Three view modes cover every planning horizon

**Cons:**
- Google Calendar sync is read-only; you can't push events back to Google from Obsidian
- CalDAV setup requires careful attention to credentials and server URLs
- Color customization is limited to the source level, not individual events
- Performance degrades with very large source folders

**Bottom line**: If your workflow involves any external calendar—work, school, or personal—Full Calendar is the only Obsidian plugin worth using. The iCal sync gets you 80% of the way there in five minutes. CalDAV with [Fastmail](URL_PLACEHOLDER_4) gets you the full two-way integration that makes Obsidian genuinely replace your standalone calendar app for day-to-day use.

[Install the Full Calendar plugin from the Community Plugins browser](URL_PLACEHOLDER_1) and spend 20 minutes following the setup guide above. The investment pays back within the first week of daily use.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is the Full Calendar plugin free?

Yes. It's fully open-source under the MIT license. There is no paid tier or pro version.

### Q: Can I sync Full Calendar with Apple Calendar (iCloud)?

Yes, via CalDAV. Use `https://caldav.icloud.com/` as the server URL and an app-specific password from your Apple ID settings. The two-way sync works reliably.

### Q: Does Full Calendar work on Obsidian mobile?

The calendar renders on iOS and Android, but CalDAV sync can be unreliable on mobile due to network permission handling. Local events work fine. iCal read-only sync works on most setups.

### Q: Will my events still exist if I uninstall the plugin?

Yes. Local events are standard markdown files with frontmatter. They remain in your vault and are fully readable without the plugin. External CalDAV events aren't stored locally.

### Q: How is this different from using Obsidian's built-in daily notes calendar?

The built-in calendar plugin only lets you navigate to daily notes by date—it shows no events, allows no scheduling, and has no external sync. Full Calendar is a separate, more capable system that treats notes as schedulable events with times, drag-and-drop, and live sync.

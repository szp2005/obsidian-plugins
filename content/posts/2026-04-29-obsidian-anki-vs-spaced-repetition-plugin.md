# Obsidian Anki vs Spaced Repetition Plugin: Which One Actually Fits Your Workflow?

---

**TL;DR**

- The **Obsidian to Anki plugin** is the right pick if you already live inside Anki and want your notes to feed that ecosystem automatically.
- The **Spaced Repetition (SR) plugin** wins if you want a zero-friction, all-in-one setup that never pulls you out of your vault.
- Neither is universally better — your existing tools and daily habits should make the decision for you.

## 1. The Power of Spaced Repetition in Your Second Brain {#the-power-of-spaced-repetition}

Spaced repetition is not a productivity hack. It is a well-documented cognitive technique rooted in Hermann Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve research from the 1880s, refined over a century, and validated repeatedly in modern cognitive science. The core mechanic: review material at increasing intervals just before you're likely to forget it. Combine that with active recall — forcing yourself to retrieve information rather than re-read it — and you have the most efficient long-term memory system available to a human learner.

If you want a rigorous grounding in the science before you touch a single plugin, [Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning](URL_PLACEHOLDER_1) by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel is the most accessible, research-backed book on the subject.

Now layer that onto Obsidian. Obsidian is a local-first, Markdown-based note editor built on the principle that your notes should form a connected knowledge graph, not siloed documents. It's the ideal home for a Zettelkasten or any other personal knowledge management system precisely because notes link to each other, and ideas compound over time.

The obvious next step: use that accumulated knowledge for deliberate practice, not just reference. That's where the flashcard question gets thorny. Obsidian has two dominant approaches, and they are genuinely different tools serving genuinely different users.

## 2. Deep Dive: The Obsidian to Anki Plugin {#deep-dive-obsidian-to-anki}

### Core Concept

The [Obsidian to Anki plugin](URL_PLACEHOLDER_2) acts as a bridge. You write notes in Obsidian using special syntax, run a sync, and those notes become cards inside your Anki deck. Anki does all the actual scheduling, reviewing, and algorithm work. Obsidian is the authoring environment; Anki is the review environment.

### How It Actually Works

The plugin requires [AnkiConnect](URL_PLACEHOLDER_3), a free Anki add-on that opens a local API so the Obsidian plugin can push cards into your Anki collection. The flow is:

1. Write a note with designated card syntax (e.g., `TARGET DECK` comment, `START/END` block markers, or inline cloze deletions).
2. Open Anki so AnkiConnect is running.
3. Trigger a sync from Obsidian's command palette.
4. Your cards appear in Anki, ready for review.

Updates to the note in Obsidian propagate back to Anki on the next sync. Deleted notes optionally clear the corresponding Anki cards.

### Who It's For

This plugin is purpose-built for people who are **already Anki users** or who want access to Anki's broader ecosystem. If you have years of card history, custom note types, mature decks from medical school, or a library of Anki add-ons you depend on (AnkiMath for LaTeX, Image Occlusion Enhanced, etc.), this plugin lets you keep all of that while drafting cards inside your vault.

### Pros

- Full access to Anki's scheduling algorithm (SM-2 or FSRS 5 via add-ons).
- Every Anki add-on remains available — image occlusion, audio, stats overlays, you name it.
- Anki's mobile apps (iOS and Android) are mature, offline-capable, and well-maintained.
- Your card history stays in Anki, which means long-term retention data persists even if you switch vaults.
- Cards can use Anki's rich HTML/CSS styling and custom note types.

### Cons

- You must have Anki installed and open during sync — two apps running simultaneously.
- Initial setup (AnkiConnect + plugin configuration + syntax learning) takes 30–60 minutes.
- The card-creation syntax is specific and non-trivial; writing natural notes requires discipline to avoid cluttering Markdown files with Anki-specific markup.
- Sync is one-way for content. Scheduling data lives in Anki only.
- Not beginner-friendly if you have zero prior Anki experience.

## 3. Deep Dive: The Spaced Repetition Plugin {#deep-dive-sr-plugin}

### Core Concept

The [Spaced Repetition (SR) plugin](URL_PLACEHOLDER_4) for Obsidian is a fully self-contained system. Cards are created, stored, and reviewed without ever leaving Obsidian. There is no external dependency. Your flashcard data is embedded directly in your Markdown files as YAML front matter.

### How It Actually Works

The plugin scans your vault for two types of content:

- **Inline flashcards**: `Question :: Answer` on a single line.
- **Multi-line cards**: `Question` on one line, `?` on the next, then the answer.
- **Cloze deletions**: `==highlighted text==` becomes a cloze.

During review, a modal appears inside Obsidian showing your card queue. You rate each card (Again / Hard / Good / Easy), and the plugin updates the scheduling data in the note's front matter. The default algorithm is FSRS, which is a significant upgrade over the older SM-2 and means the scheduling is genuinely competitive with Anki's default behavior.

### Who It's For

This plugin is ideal for users who want a **frictionless, single-app workflow**. If your priority is reducing context-switching and keeping everything inside one environment, SR plugin wins on setup speed and daily convenience by a significant margin.

### Pros

- Zero external dependencies — install the plugin and start reviewing in under five minutes.
- Card creation is embedded directly in note-writing; no special syntax blocks required beyond `::` separators.
- FSRS algorithm provides high-quality scheduling without any configuration.
- Reviews happen inside Obsidian, so you can click links, view backlinks, or edit the note while reviewing.
- Vault-level due-date tracking means you can see what's due across all notes in one place.
- Works on Obsidian mobile with [Obsidian Sync](URL_PLACEHOLDER_5) or any sync solution you already use.

### Cons

- Review interface is a modal/panel inside Obsidian — it is functional but not as polished as Anki's dedicated review environment.
- No image occlusion, audio support, or equivalent of Anki's rich add-on library.
- Scheduling data is stored as front matter in Markdown files, which means it can create visual noise in notes or complicate frontmatter-heavy workflows.
- No separate card history or long-term statistics comparable to Anki's mature stats system.
- Mobile review depends on your vault sync being set up and stable.

## 5. Decision Framework: Which Plugin Is Right for You? {#decision-framework}

Work through these questions in order. Stop as soon as you hit a clear answer.

```
Are you already an active Anki user with existing decks?
├── YES → Use the Obsidian to Anki plugin. Protect your card history.
└── NO
    │
    Do you need advanced card types (image occlusion, audio, LaTeX-heavy cards)?
    ├── YES → Use Obsidian to Anki. Only Anki's ecosystem covers this.
    └── NO
        │
        Do you want to review on mobile frequently?
        ├── YES, and I want a native app experience → Obsidian to Anki.
        ├── YES, and I already use Obsidian mobile with a sync solution → SR Plugin.
        └── NO
            │
            Do you want to set this up in under 10 minutes and stay in one app?
            └── YES → Spaced Repetition Plugin. Done.
```

**The rule of thumb**: If you have never used Anki, start with the SR plugin. If you have used Anki for more than six months and built up card history you care about, use the Obsidian to Anki plugin and don't look back.

## 6. User Persona Workflows: Seeing Each Plugin in Practice {#user-persona-workflows}

### Persona 1: Medical Student (3rd Year, Existing Anki User)

**Tool: Obsidian to Anki**

Maria has 15,000 Anki cards from her first two years. She starts writing clinical case notes in Obsidian to build a connected knowledge graph. Using the Anki plugin, she marks key facts in her notes:

```
START
Basic
What is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults?
Back: Streptococcus pneumoniae
END
```

She syncs once per study session. Her Anki deck grows organically from her clinical notes. She reviews during her commute using AnkiDroid. Her existing card history informs the scheduling — she isn't starting from scratch. The Obsidian graph shows her connected knowledge; Anki handles the memory.

### Persona 2: Language Learner (Self-Teaching Japanese)

**Tool: Spaced Repetition Plugin**

James is building a Japanese vocabulary vault in Obsidian. Each note is a word, with its reading, meaning, example sentences, and links to related words. He adds a card inline:

```
日本語 (にほんご) :: Japanese language
```

During his morning routine, he opens Obsidian, runs his review queue in under ten minutes, and goes back to adding new words. The entire loop — note creation, linking, and review — happens in one window. He doesn't want to manage two apps. FSRS schedules his 400+ cards efficiently. For a learner whose cards are primarily text-based vocabulary items, the SR plugin covers everything he needs.

### Persona 3: Professional Learning a New Skill (Product Manager studying SQL)

**Tool: Spaced Repetition Plugin (starter) → Obsidian to Anki (if depth increases)**

David is learning SQL to reduce his dependency on analysts for data questions. He creates a vault with SQL concept notes and uses the SR plugin to test himself on syntax and query patterns. His cards are simple:

```
What does GROUP BY do? :: Aggregates rows that share values in specified columns
```

If David's learning remains at a conceptual level, the SR plugin is all he needs. If he eventually needs to test himself on query output visually (using image-based cards to recognize output formats), he has a clear upgrade path to the Anki plugin without losing his note-writing workflow.

## 8. Conclusion: Seamless Learning or Powerful Separation? {#conclusion}

The core trade-off is simple: **integration versus power**.

The **Spaced Repetition plugin** keeps your entire learning workflow inside a single application. Card creation is frictionless. Setup takes minutes, not hours. FSRS ensures the scheduling is genuinely good, not a hobbyist approximation. For most Obsidian users starting fresh with spaced repetition, this is where you should begin.

The **Obsidian to Anki plugin** hands your cards to the most battle-tested flashcard application in existence. You get every Anki add-on, a mature mobile experience, detailed statistics, and a review environment built specifically for flashcards. The trade-off is complexity and context-switching. If you are already inside Anki's ecosystem, this plugin is a clear upgrade to how you create cards — it just isn't a standalone solution.

If you are a complete newcomer to both tools: **start with the SR plugin**. Get your first 100 cards created and build the habit. If you hit its limits — you need image occlusion, you want detailed stats, or you want to review without opening your laptop — migrate to the Anki integration at that point. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive forever; they are entry points for different stages of the same learning journey.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use both plugins at the same time in the same vault?

Technically yes, but it creates confusion fast. If you use the Anki plugin for some notes and the SR plugin for others, you end up with two separate review queues in two different apps with no unified scheduling. Pick one per subject domain at minimum, or just commit to one system vault-wide.

### Does the Spaced Repetition plugin work on Obsidian mobile?

Yes. If your vault syncs to your phone (via [Obsidian Sync](URL_PLACEHOLDER_13), iCloud, Syncthing, or any other solution), the SR plugin runs on Obsidian mobile and the review interface works. It's not a native mobile app experience, but it is functional for daily reviews.

### What happens to my Anki cards if I change the note in Obsidian?

The Obsidian to Anki plugin propagates updates on the next sync. If you edit the question or answer in Obsidian, the corresponding Anki card updates. Scheduling data in Anki is preserved — the plugin only touches the card content, not the review history.

### Is the FSRS algorithm in the SR plugin as good as Anki's FSRS implementation?

Both implementations are based on the same open FSRS research by Jarrett Ye. Anki's implementation (FSRS 5 as of 2024) is more mature, includes parameter optimization based on your personal review history, and has had more testing at scale. The SR plugin's FSRS implementation is solid and a significant step up from SM-2, but for users who want optimized parameters based on thousands of personal data points, Anki's version has the edge.

### Can I migrate my SR plugin cards to Anki later if I outgrow the plugin?

Not automatically. Your cards exist as Markdown syntax inside notes, and there's no one-click export to Anki format. You would need to restructure those notes to use the Anki plugin's syntax and re-sync. It's doable but takes effort. This is one practical reason to decide your tool before you build a large card library, rather than after.

## Why Go Beyond Backlinks? The Power of Spatial Note-Taking {#why-go-beyond-backlinks}

Obsidian's graph view is excellent for showing *how* your notes connect conceptually. But there's a class of relationship it can't show at all: *where* things happen.

If you're a travel writer, every restaurant review and hotel note has a physical address. If you're writing a fantasy novel, your kingdoms, rivers, and battlefields occupy a map. If you're a historian, every primary source has a location. Backlinks alone can't surface those spatial patterns.

Spatial note-taking closes that gap. When you pin a note to a coordinate—real or fictional—you can immediately see clustering, proximity, and geography. A researcher mapping disease outbreaks spots a neighborhood pattern instantly. A D&D dungeon master sees that the dragon's lair sits three days' walk from the nearest city. A traveler reviews their Southeast Asia trip not as a list of notes but as a literal route.

The Obsidian Leaflet plugin makes all of that possible without leaving Obsidian, without a separate GIS application, and without touching a database.

## Getting Started: Installing the Obsidian Leaflet Plugin {#getting-started-installing}

**What is the Leaflet plugin?** It's a community plugin that embeds a [Leaflet.js](URL_PLACEHOLDER_1) powered map directly inside any Obsidian note. You define the map using a fenced code block. The plugin handles rendering, zooming, panning, and marker interaction.

**Installation steps:**

1. Open Obsidian and go to **Settings → Community Plugins**.
2. Toggle off **Safe Mode** if it's on (required for any community plugin).
3. Click **Browse**, then search for **Obsidian Leaflet**.
4. Click **Install**, then **Enable**.
5. Verify it's working: create a new note and paste this minimal block:

````markdown
```leaflet
id: test-map
lat: 48.8566
long: 2.3522
height: 300px
zoom: 5
```
````

You should see an interactive OpenStreetMap view centered on Paris. If you do, you're ready.

**Tip:** The `id` field is mandatory and must be unique across your entire vault. Leaflet uses it to persist marker positions and zoom state between sessions.

## Your First Interactive Map: A 5-Minute Tutorial {#your-first-interactive-map}

Every Leaflet map lives inside a fenced code block tagged with `leaflet`. Here's the anatomy:

````markdown
```leaflet
id: my-first-map
lat: 35.6762
long: 139.6503
height: 500px
zoom: 6
minZoom: 3
maxZoom: 18
defaultZoom: 6
unit: miles
scale: 1
marker: default, 35.6762, 139.6503, [[Tokyo Notes]]
```
````

**Breaking it down:**

| Parameter | What it does |
|---|---|
| `id` | Unique identifier (required) |
| `lat` / `long` | Center coordinates on load |
| `height` | Height of the rendered map in your note |
| `zoom` | Initial zoom level (1 = world, 18 = street) |
| `minZoom` / `maxZoom` | Restrict how far the user can zoom |
| `unit` | Distance units for the scale bar |
| `marker` | Adds a pin: `type, lat, long, [[linked note]]` |

**Adding markers:** Each `marker:` line drops a pin. The fourth argument is an Obsidian wikilink—click the pin in the map and the linked note opens. You can add as many marker lines as you need.

```
marker: default, 48.8566, 2.3522, [[Paris Research]]
marker: default, 51.5074, -0.1278, [[London Notes]]
marker: default, 52.5200, 13.4050, [[Berlin Field Work]]
```

That's your first working multi-marker map.

## Advanced Mapping: Custom Markers, Overlays, and Data {#advanced-mapping}

### Custom Marker Types

The plugin ships with a `default` marker type, but you can define your own in **Settings → Obsidian Leaflet → Marker Types**. Each custom type gets:
- A name
- An icon from the [Font Awesome 5 free set](URL_PLACEHOLDER_2)
- A hex color

Once defined, use the type name in your marker lines:

```
marker: restaurant, 48.8606, 2.3376, [[Le Marais Café]]
marker: museum, 48.8606, 2.3376, [[Pompidou Centre]]
```

### GeoJSON Overlays

For borders, routes, and regions, Leaflet accepts GeoJSON. Create a `.geojson` file in your vault and reference it:

```
geojson: [[regions/northern-kingdom.geojson]]
```

GeoJSON is the standard format for geographic shapes. Tools like [geojson.io](URL_PLACEHOLDER_3) let you draw polygons and export the file directly.

### Pulling Data from YAML Frontmatter

Instead of hardcoding coordinates in the map block, you can store them in the note itself. In each location note, add:

```yaml
---
location: [48.8566, 2.3522]
tags: [travel, france]
---
```

Then in your map block, reference those notes as a data source:

```leaflet
id: travel-master
lat: 20
long: 0
height: 600px
zoom: 2
markerFile: [[Paris Research]]
markerFile: [[Tokyo Notes]]
markerFile: [[Berlin Field Work]]
```

Each `markerFile` reference reads the `location` field from that note's frontmatter and places a marker automatically. The link from the marker back to the note is also set automatically.

---

## Practical Use-Cases and Copy-Paste Templates {#practical-use-cases}

### For the Traveler: World Travel Log

Store this template in a `Maps/` folder and update `markerFile` lines as you add new destination notes.

````markdown
```leaflet
id: world-travel-log
lat: 20
long: 0
height: 600px
zoom: 2
unit: kilometers
scale: 1
markerTag: travel
```
````

With `markerTag: travel`, the plugin automatically pins every note in your vault that has `tags: [travel]` *and* a `location:` field in frontmatter. Add a new trip note, tag it, set coordinates—it appears on the map instantly.

### For the World-Builder: Fictional Kingdom Map

First, create your map image (PNG or JPG). [Wonderdraft](URL_PLACEHOLDER_4) is the purpose-built tool for this—it produces print-quality fantasy maps and exports at whatever resolution you need. Once you have your image:

````markdown
```leaflet
id: kingdom-of-aldrath
image: [[maps/aldrath-continent.jpg]]
height: 700px
lat: 50
long: 50
zoom: 3
unit: leagues
scale: 0.5
marker: city, 60, 45, [[Stonehaven Capital]]
marker: dungeon, 30, 70, [[The Ashen Vault]]
marker: forest, 50, 55, [[Whispering Wood]]
```
````

For image-based maps, `lat`/`long` are percentages of the image dimensions (0–100), not real-world coordinates. Set `unit` to anything meaningful for your fiction. The [Dungeondraft](URL_PLACEHOLDER_5) companion app handles interior maps, taverns, and dungeons at the same level of quality.

### For the Researcher: Historical Events Map

````markdown
```leaflet
id: ww1-western-front
lat: 50.0
long: 3.5
height: 550px
zoom: 7
markerTag: ww1-event
geojson: [[research/western-front-line.geojson]]
```
````

Tag every battle note with `ww1-event`, add coordinates to frontmatter, and the map populates automatically. The GeoJSON overlay draws the front line as a polygon.

## Automate Your Maps with the Dataview Plugin {#automate-with-dataview}

[Dataview](URL_PLACEHOLDER_6) is a community plugin that lets you query your vault like a database. Combined with Leaflet's `markerTag` parameter, it creates self-updating maps.

**Setup:**

1. Install Dataview from Community Plugins.
2. In every location note, standardize your frontmatter:

```yaml
---
location: [lat, long]
tags: [research, paris]
visited: true
date: 2024-03-15
---
```

3. Use `markerTag` in your Leaflet block to filter:

```
markerTag: [research, visited]
```

This pins only notes that carry *all* listed tags. Add a new research note with both tags and coordinates—it appears on your master map on the next render without touching the map block.

**Advanced: Dataview table alongside the map**

Put a Dataview query in the same note as your map block to get a synchronized list view:

````markdown
```dataview
TABLE location, date, file.link AS "Note"
FROM #research
WHERE location != null
SORT date DESC
```
````

You now have the map above and a sortable table of every mapped location below. Clicking a row opens the note; clicking the pin does the same thing.

## CSS Styling Guide for Maps and Markers {#css-styling-guide}

Add these snippets to your vault's CSS snippets folder (**Settings → Appearance → CSS Snippets**).

**Make the map border rounded and add a subtle shadow:**

```css
.leaflet-container {
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.18);
  border: 1px solid var(--background-modifier-border);
}
```

**Style the marker popup window:**

```css
.leaflet-popup-content-wrapper {
  background: var(--background-primary);
  color: var(--text-normal);
  border-radius: 6px;
  font-size: 0.9em;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

.leaflet-popup-tip {
  background: var(--background-primary);
}
```

**Highlight custom marker types differently—example for `restaurant`:**

```css
.leaflet-marker-icon[data-marker-type="restaurant"] {
  filter: hue-rotate(120deg) saturate(1.5);
}
```

**Dark mode map tiles** (requires a tile layer that supports dark mode—Stadia Alidade Smooth Dark is a free option): In Leaflet plugin settings, replace the tile URL with:

```
https://tiles.stadiamaps.com/tiles/alidade_smooth_dark/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png
```

For planning complex projects before you map them, a mind-mapping session with a tool from [Setapp](URL_PLACEHOLDER_7)—which bundles MindNode and dozens of other Mac productivity apps in one subscription—can help you figure out your node structure before committing it to coordinates.

## Troubleshooting and FAQ {#troubleshooting-faq}

**FAQ**

**Q1: My map is just a grey box. What's wrong?**
Check that your `id` is unique across the vault. Duplicate IDs cause the map to fail silently. Also confirm the plugin is enabled—go to Settings → Community Plugins and verify the toggle is on. If tiles aren't loading, check your internet connection; real-world maps require a tile server connection.

**Q2: How do I find the latitude and longitude for a location?**
Right-click any point on [Google Maps](URL_PLACEHOLDER_8) and the coordinates appear at the top of the context menu. Alternatively, search the location on maps.google.com and read the lat/long from the URL. For fictional maps, remember you're working in a 0–100 percentage system based on image dimensions.

**Q3: Can I use my own image as a map background?**
Yes. Drop a PNG or JPG anywhere in your vault, then reference it with `image: [[path/to/your-image.jpg]]`. Coordinates become percentages of the image's pixel dimensions, not geographic coordinates. Set `lat: 50` and `long: 50` to center on the image initially.

**Q4: Why are my `markerFile` markers not appearing?**
Confirm the referenced note has a `location:` field formatted exactly as `location: [lat, long]`—it must be an array, not a string. The brackets are required.

**Q5: Is the Leaflet plugin still maintained?**
The original repository by valentine195 has been forked and is actively maintained by the Obsidian community under [obsidian-leaflet](URL_PLACEHOLDER_9). Check the community plugins browser for the current version. As of 2024, it remains one of the most downloaded Obsidian plugins with regular updates.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Creating interactive maps in Obsidian is genuinely one of the most underused features in the entire ecosystem. The Leaflet plugin turns what is essentially a text editor into a spatial knowledge system—you can map your travel memories, build a living atlas for your fiction, or track a research project across geography, all without leaving your notes.

The path from zero to functional map takes about five minutes. The path from a basic map to a fully automated, Dataview-powered, custom-styled mapping system takes an afternoon. Neither requires programming knowledge—just an understanding of YAML and a willingness to experiment with the code block syntax.

If you're building a fictional world, invest in [Wonderdraft](URL_PLACEHOLDER_10) for your base map image—it's a one-time purchase that produces far better results than any web tool. If you want to go deeper on data visualization and make your maps genuinely analytical, a structured course on [Skillshare or Udemy](URL_PLACEHOLDER_11) covering data visualization principles will dramatically raise the ceiling of what you can build.

Start with the five-minute tutorial. Add your three most important locations. Then come back for the Dataview integration when you're ready to make it scale.

# Obsidian Sync vs Syncthing for Free Note Synchronization: The Honest Comparison

**TL;DR**
- Obsidian Sync costs $4–$10/month and takes minutes to configure; Syncthing is completely free but requires manual setup on every device you own.
- Both offer strong security — Obsidian Sync uses end-to-end encryption on their servers; Syncthing sends data directly between your devices with TLS, touching no third-party server.
- Your decision comes down to one question: is your time worth more than the subscription fee, or is total data control worth a few hours of tinkering?

## The Core Dilemma: Paid Convenience vs. Free Control {#the-core-dilemma}

Obsidian stores your notes as plain Markdown files on your local drive. That's a deliberate design choice — your data stays yours. The problem is "local-first" means syncing across your laptop, desktop, phone, and tablet becomes your problem, not the app's.

Obsidian's official answer is Obsidian Sync, a polished paid add-on. The community's most popular free answer is [Syncthing](URL_PLACEHOLDER_1), an open-source peer-to-peer sync tool. Both work. Neither is objectively superior. The right choice depends entirely on your situation.

Here is the quick summary before we dig in:

| Category | Obsidian Sync | Syncthing |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | $4–$10/month | Free forever |
| **Setup time** | ~5 minutes | 30–90 minutes |
| **Encryption** | E2EE (on Obsidian servers) | TLS P2P (no central server) |
| **Version history** | Built-in (up to 12 months) | Optional, manual configuration |
| **iOS support** | Native, first-class | Via Möbius Sync (workaround) |
| **Android support** | Native | Direct Syncthing app |
| **Maintenance** | Near-zero | Occasional troubleshooting |
| **Data control** | Obsidian holds encrypted data | You hold all data |
| **Winner** | Convenience | Privacy + Cost |

## Deep Dive: Obsidian Sync {#deep-dive-obsidian-sync}

Obsidian Sync is the first-party, cloud-based synchronization service built directly into the Obsidian app. You subscribe, log in on each device, point it at your vault, and you are done.

**What you get:**
- **End-to-end encryption** with a passphrase you control. Even Obsidian cannot read your notes.
- **Version history** going back up to 12 months on the Plus plan, letting you recover deleted notes or roll back edits.
- **Conflict resolution** that is automatic and transparent — Obsidian creates a separate copy of conflicting files rather than silently overwriting one.
- **Selective sync** so you can exclude folders (like a large attachments folder) to stay within your storage quota.
- **Official support** if something breaks.

**The pricing reality:** The standard Obsidian Sync plan is $4/month (billed annually) with 10 GB of storage and 1 year of version history. The Plus plan is $8/month (billed annually) with 100 GB and 12 months of history. These prices are reasonable for a professional tool, but $48–$96/year adds up, especially if you are already paying for Notion, Roam, or other productivity software.

**Who it is for:** Anyone who opens their vault on multiple devices daily and needs that experience to be invisible. If you sit down to write a meeting note and do not want to think about whether your phone synced last night, Obsidian Sync earns its fee.

## Deep Dive: Syncthing {#deep-dive-syncthing}

[Syncthing](URL_PLACEHOLDER_2) is an open-source file synchronization program maintained by a nonprofit foundation. It is free, contains no ads, and collects no data. Instead of routing your files through a cloud server, it establishes direct encrypted connections between your devices using TLS with certificate-based device authentication.

**What you get:**
- **Zero cost.** Permanently.
- **No central server.** Your vault files travel directly from device A to device B. Nobody in the middle can see them.
- **File versioning** as an optional setting — Syncthing can keep N previous versions of any changed file in a hidden `.stversions` folder.
- **Granular control:** Sync frequency, ignore patterns (equivalent to `.gitignore`), folder types (send-only, receive-only, or bidirectional).
- **Cross-platform:** Windows, macOS, Linux, Android. iOS via the third-party [Möbius Sync](URL_PLACEHOLDER_3) app.

**The catch:** Syncthing is peer-to-peer. For two devices to sync, at least one of them must be online. If your phone and laptop are both off, nothing syncs. The practical solution is an always-on device — a home server, a [Raspberry Pi](URL_PLACEHOLDER_4), a [Synology NAS](URL_PLACEHOLDER_5), or a cheap cloud VPS — that acts as a relay node. This is not strictly required, but without it, syncing only happens when both devices are running simultaneously.

**Who it is for:** Privacy advocates who are uncomfortable with any third party holding their notes (even encrypted), developers comfortable with terminal commands and configuration files, and anyone who needs to eliminate a recurring subscription.

## Feature-by-Feature Showdown {#feature-by-feature-showdown}

### Cost
Obsidian Sync: $48/year minimum. Syncthing: $0. Over five years, Obsidian Sync costs $240+. That is real money.

### Setup and Maintenance
Obsidian Sync requires creating an account, subscribing, and enabling the plugin inside Obsidian. Syncthing requires installing the application, generating device IDs, adding each device as a "remote," sharing a folder, and confirming on both ends. Android adds the Syncthing app from F-Droid or Google Play. iOS requires downloading Möbius Sync and pointing it at your vault's folder location.

### Security and Privacy
Both use strong encryption. The philosophical difference is significant: Obsidian Sync encrypts your data before it touches their server, so Obsidian theoretically cannot read it. Syncthing never touches a third-party server at all — data goes directly device-to-device. If you work with sensitive material (legal, medical, financial) and want the smallest possible attack surface, Syncthing wins on architecture alone.

### Version History
Obsidian Sync: built-in, browsable in the sidebar, easy to restore. Syncthing: you need to enable file versioning in folder settings. The "Staggered File Versioning" option keeps hourly backups for 24 hours, daily for 30 days, and weekly indefinitely. It works, but there is no GUI to browse and restore — you manually find the file in `.stversions`.

### Conflict Resolution
Obsidian Sync creates a new file with "conflicted copy" appended to the name when two devices edit the same note before syncing. You merge manually, but nothing is lost. Syncthing does the same — it renames the conflicting version as `filename.sync-conflict-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-DEVICEID.md`. You will see this in your vault root occasionally. It is not elegant, but it is safe.

### Mobile Experience
On Android, the native Syncthing app is solid. On iOS, Obsidian Sync is dramatically better. Möbius Sync works, but it requires Obsidian to keep the Möbius folder open during sync, background sync is limited by iOS restrictions, and you need to manually open the app periodically to trigger a full sync. Heavy iOS users will feel this friction daily.

## How to Set Up Syncthing for Obsidian {#setup-guide}

### Step 1: Install Syncthing on Your Primary Computer

**Windows/Mac:** Download the installer from [syncthing.net](URL_PLACEHOLDER_6). Run it. Syncthing opens a web UI in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8384`.

### Step 2: Add Your Obsidian Vault as a Synced Folder

In the Syncthing web UI, click **Add Folder**. Set the folder path to your Obsidian vault directory (e.g., `C:\Users\You\Documents\ObsidianVault` or `~/Documents/ObsidianVault`). Give it a recognizable label. Under **Versioning**, select "Staggered File Versioning" to protect against accidental overwrites.

**Critical: Add an ignore pattern.** Click the **Ignore Patterns** tab and add:
```
.obsidian/workspace.json
.obsidian/workspace-mobile.json
```
These files change every time you open Obsidian and cause constant false sync events. Ignoring them eliminates most spurious conflicts.

### Step 3: Connect Your Android Phone

Install [Syncthing from F-Droid](URL_PLACEHOLDER_7) or Google Play on your Android device. Open the app and copy your phone's **Device ID** from the menu.

Back in your computer's Syncthing web UI, click **Add Remote Device** and paste that ID. Accept the connection request on your phone. Then share your Obsidian vault folder with that device. On the phone, accept the folder share and set the destination path to a folder inside your phone's local storage (not SD card — it's slower and less reliable).

**Battery drain fix:** In the Android Syncthing app, go to Settings → Run conditions and enable "Sync only on Wi-Fi" and "Sync only when charging" if battery life is a concern. This reduces background activity significantly.

### Step 4: iOS Setup via Möbius Sync

Download [Möbius Sync](URL_PLACEHOLDER_8) from the App Store. Open it and go to **Add Folder**. Copy the Device ID from Möbius Sync and add it to your computer's Syncthing via **Add Remote Device**, exactly as you did with Android. Share your vault folder with Möbius Sync. In Obsidian on iOS, open the vault from the Möbius Sync–managed folder location.

**iOS pitfall:** iOS aggressively kills background processes. For reliable sync, open Möbius Sync briefly before switching to Obsidian. This is the most significant usability gap compared to Obsidian Sync on iOS.

### Optional: Set Up an Always-On Node

For reliable sync when your devices are not on the same network, you need a device that is always on. Options:

- **Home option:** A [Raspberry Pi 4](URL_PLACEHOLDER_9) ($50–80) running Syncthing, plugged in to your router. Initial setup takes about two hours. After that, it runs indefinitely with near-zero power draw.
- **Cloud option:** A $5/month VPS from [DigitalOcean](URL_PLACEHOLDER_10) or [Vultr](URL_PLACEHOLDER_11) with Syncthing installed. This is better if you travel often — a home server on your home network still needs your router to be reachable from the internet (which requires port forwarding or a relay). A cloud VPS handles this automatically.

## Who Is This Actually For? Decision Matrix {#decision-matrix}

| User Persona | Best Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| **The Busy Professional** — bills by the hour, uses iOS and Mac | Obsidian Sync | iOS friction with Syncthing eats time daily; $4/month is trivial vs. lost productivity |
| **The Privacy-Conscious Tinkerer** — technical background, Linux or Android user | Syncthing | No third-party server contact; full control; one-time setup |
| **The Student on a Budget** — Windows + Android, moderate tech skill | Syncthing | Free, Android support is strong, one weekend of setup |
| **The Cross-Platform Heavy User** — iOS + Android + 3 desktops | Obsidian Sync | Too many devices to configure; native support on all platforms |
| **The Enterprise Employee** — notes contain client or company data | Syncthing (self-hosted) | Data never leaves internal infrastructure |
| **The Casual Notetaker** — one laptop + one phone, light usage | Obsidian Sync free trial first, then Syncthing if cost matters | Start free, evaluate the friction before paying |

## The Hidden Costs of Each Option {#hidden-costs}

The word "free" in Syncthing deserves scrutiny. Here is what Syncthing actually costs you:

**Time investment:** Initial setup across two devices: 1–2 hours. Adding a third device: 30 minutes. Adding iOS: 45 minutes. First conflict resolution: 20 minutes of confusion. Total first-month cost: 3–4 hours.

**Maintenance overhead:** Syncthing is stable, but updates occasionally require attention. Conflict files appear in your vault and need manual cleanup. If you set up a home server or VPS, that device needs occasional OS updates. Budget one hour per month on average.

**Opportunity cost:** Every minute you spend troubleshooting a `.sync-conflict` file is a minute you are not writing notes. For productive, high-volume users, this friction is real.

**Obsidian Sync's hidden cost** is simpler — it is purely monetary. But consider what that money funds: active development of Obsidian itself. The plugin is effectively how Obsidian generates revenue to stay independent and continue building.

## Beyond the Big Two {#beyond-the-big-two}

**iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox:** These work if you use Obsidian's "Open folder as vault" from a cloud-synced folder. They are convenient but come with privacy trade-offs — your notes sit on Google's or Apple's servers, readable under their terms of service. Dropbox and Google Drive also have no E2EE.

**Git-based sync:** Using a private GitHub or GitLab repository with the Obsidian Git plugin gives you version history and free sync, but requires comfort with Git. Merge conflicts in Markdown files are manageable but more annoying than Syncthing's file-duplication approach. On mobile, the Git plugin has limitations. Good option for developers already living in the terminal.

**Resilio Sync:** Similar to Syncthing (peer-to-peer, no central server) but closed-source and freemium. There is no compelling reason to choose it over Syncthing unless you need its specific features.

Syncthing remains the top free recommendation for privacy-focused users because it is open-source, free for all features, actively maintained, and works reliably across Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

## The Verdict {#the-verdict}

**Use Obsidian Sync if:**
- You use iOS as a primary device and hate friction
- You sync across more than three devices regularly
- You want built-in version history you can browse visually
- Your time has clear monetary value and $4/month is not a decision

**Use Syncthing if:**
- You want zero recurring costs
- You are uncomfortable with any third party holding your data, even encrypted
- You use Android (or are willing to use Möbius Sync on iOS)
- You can invest a few hours upfront and a small amount of ongoing maintenance

Neither option is wrong. Obsidian Sync is the right answer for users who open their wallet to solve problems. Syncthing is the right answer for users who open a terminal. Both are meaningfully better than leaving your vault on one device.

If you are still undecided, spend one month on Syncthing. If a conflict file stresses you out or your iOS sync feels unreliable, pay for Obsidian Sync without guilt. If you make it to month two without issues, you will probably never pay for sync again.

## Conclusion

The obsidian sync vs syncthing debate does not have a universally correct answer, and anyone telling you otherwise is selling something. What exists is a straightforward trade: money for convenience, or time for control.

If Syncthing fits your setup, [download it now](URL_PLACEHOLDER_12) — it is free, takes an hour to configure, and you will own that configuration forever. If you want reliable sync on iOS without compromise, or you simply want to stop thinking about it, [start your Obsidian Sync trial](URL_PLACEHOLDER_13). It is the most direct way to support the tool you are already using every day.

For Syncthing users who want that always-on reliability node, a [Raspberry Pi starter kit](URL_PLACEHOLDER_14) is the cleanest home solution, or spin up a [$5/month DigitalOcean droplet](URL_PLACEHOLDER_15) if you need something accessible from anywhere without port forwarding headaches.

Your notes are your thinking. Make sure they follow you reliably, whatever that takes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Syncthing safe enough for sensitive personal notes?

Yes. Syncthing uses TLS 1.3 for all transfers and verifies each device with a unique certificate. No third party can intercept your data in transit. The risk profile is similar to sending files over SSH — effectively zero for personal notes if your devices are not compromised.

### Can I use Syncthing on iOS without Möbius Sync?

No. Apple's iOS restrictions prevent third-party apps from running persistent background processes that access arbitrary file locations. Möbius Sync is the only mature workaround. It functions acceptably for moderate usage but is inferior to Obsidian Sync's native iOS experience.

### What happens to my notes if Obsidian the company shuts down?

Your notes remain on your device as plain Markdown files — you never lose them. Obsidian Sync would stop working, but you could switch to Syncthing or any other sync method the same day. This is one of the concrete benefits of Obsidian's local-first architecture.

### Do I need an always-on device for Syncthing to work?

Not strictly. If your laptop and phone are both online at the same time and connected (on the same Wi-Fi or via Syncthing's relay servers), they will sync. The relay servers Syncthing uses for NAT traversal involve minimal data — metadata only, not file content. However, if you frequently switch between networks or need sync to happen overnight while your laptop is sleeping, an always-on node makes the experience dramatically more reliable.

### Can I use both Obsidian Sync and Syncthing at the same time?

Technically yes, but do not do this. Running two sync tools on the same folder simultaneously creates racing conditions — both tools try to push changes at the same time, generating conflict files faster than you can delete them. Pick one and use it exclusively.

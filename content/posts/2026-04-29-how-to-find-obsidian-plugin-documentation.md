# How to Find Obsidian Plugin Documentation: Every Method, Step by Step

**TL;DR**
- The fastest starting point is inside Obsidian itself — the Community Plugins browser gives you the GitHub link for any plugin in two clicks.
- GitHub is the primary source for most plugin documentation; look for the README, the Wiki tab, and any linked dedicated sites.
- When docs fail you, the Obsidian Forum, Discord, and the plugin's GitHub Issues tab are your best fallbacks.

## 1. The Easiest Method: Finding Docs Directly Inside Obsidian {#easiest}

Before you open a browser, check what Obsidian already shows you. The built-in Community Plugins browser contains a surprising amount of information that most users scroll past.

**Navigate to the Community Plugins browser:**
1. Open **Settings** (gear icon, bottom-left sidebar).
2. Click **Community plugins** in the left panel.
3. If you have Safe Mode disabled, click **Browse** to open the plugin marketplace.
4. Search for your plugin by name.

**On the plugin's detail page, look at three things:**

- **The description panel.** The author writes this. It usually summarizes core functionality, lists key commands, and sometimes includes basic usage notes. For simple plugins this might be all you need.
- **The GitHub icon / repository link.** This appears near the top of the panel, next to the author's name. It's a small icon that looks like the GitHub logo. Click it. That takes you straight to the source — more on that in the next section.
- **The author link.** Some authors publish additional tutorials or a personal site. The author name is clickable and often leads to a profile page or blog with more context.

If you already have the plugin installed, go to **Settings → Community plugins → Installed plugins**, find it in the list, and click the plugin name. You get the same detail page with the same GitHub link.

---

## 2. The Definitive Source: Using the Plugin's GitHub Repository {#github}

For 95% of Obsidian community plugins, GitHub is the official documentation home. The developer chose it because it integrates version control with documentation — every update to the plugin can come with an update to the docs in the same commit.

**Finding the GitHub link:**
- From within Obsidian: use the method above. One click on the repository icon lands you on the GitHub page.
- From a browser: search `obsidian-plugin-name github` — the correct repo is almost always the first result.

**Once you're on the GitHub page, here's what to look for:**

**The README.md file.** This is the first thing you see on any repository's main page — it renders automatically below the file list. A well-maintained README will include: what the plugin does, prerequisites, installation instructions, a full list of features, configuration options, usage examples, and known limitations. Read all of it before posting questions anywhere.

**The file list.** Before scrolling to the README, scan the files at the top. Look for `docs/`, `wiki/`, or a file named `CHANGELOG.md`. A `CHANGELOG` tells you exactly what changed in each version — invaluable when a feature you read about in a tutorial no longer works the same way.

**The tabs at the top of the repository:**
- **Code** — the default view, where the README lives.
- **Issues** — user-reported bugs and feature requests (covered in section 6).
- **Wiki** — if enabled, this tab appears between "Pull requests" and "Discussions." A plugin Wiki is a separate, multi-page documentation system. When it exists, it's almost always more detailed than the README.
- **Discussions** — some developers use GitHub Discussions instead of (or alongside) the forum.

## 3. Beyond the README: Checking for a Dedicated Wiki or Website {#wiki}

Some plugins grow complex enough that a single README file can't contain everything. When that happens, developers build out either a GitHub Wiki or an entirely separate documentation site.

**How to spot links to a dedicated site from GitHub:**
- Look at the repository's **About** section (top-right corner on desktop). Developers frequently put the documentation URL there.
- Scan the top of the README for a badge or a line that says "Full documentation available at…"
- Check the GitHub Wiki tab as described above.

**Real-world examples:**

[Dataview](URL_PLACEHOLDER_1) is the most downloaded query plugin for Obsidian. Its README is brief by design — it points you to a standalone documentation site at `blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview`. That site has a full reference for every function, type, and query syntax. If you're trying to learn Dataview from the README alone, you're missing 80% of what it can do.

[Templater](URL_PLACEHOLDER_2) follows the same pattern. The README links to a dedicated site that documents every internal function, with usage examples for each one.

For complex plugins, bookmark the dedicated site immediately. Treat the README as the entry point, not the destination.

## 4. What About Core Plugins? Finding Official Obsidian Documentation {#core}

Core plugins — like Backlinks, Canvas, Daily Notes, and Tags — ship with Obsidian itself. They are maintained by the Obsidian team, not third-party developers, so their documentation lives in one place.

**The difference matters:**
- Core plugins: documented on the [official Obsidian Help site](URL_PLACEHOLDER_3).
- Community plugins: documented on GitHub (and sometimes dedicated sites).

**How to access official core plugin documentation:**
1. Go to `help.obsidian.md` in any browser.
2. Click **Plugins** in the left sidebar, then **Core plugins**.
3. Each core plugin has its own page. These pages explain every setting, every toggle, and expected behavior.

Alternatively, inside Obsidian, press `F1` or go to **Help → Obsidian Help**. This opens the official help vault directly in the app — fully searchable, works offline.

## 5. When Documentation Isn't Enough: Community and Support Channels {#community}

Sometimes docs are sparse, outdated, or don't address your exact situation. Here's where to go next.

**The Obsidian Forum** (`forum.obsidian.md`): This is the most structured community resource. Use the search bar before posting — most common plugin questions have been answered. Filter by the plugin name as a tag. If you need to post, include your Obsidian version, plugin version, and a precise description of what you expected vs. what happened.

**The Obsidian Discord**: The `#plugin-questions` channel moves fast. Good for quick answers. Not good for complex questions that need a detailed back-and-forth — use the forum for those.

**The plugin's GitHub Discussions tab**: Some developers actively respond here. It's quieter than the forum, so your question is less likely to get buried.

**Best practices before asking anywhere:**
- Read the full README and any linked documentation.
- Search the forum with the plugin name + your specific issue.
- Check if the plugin has known open issues on GitHub that match your problem.

## 6. Troubleshooting: What to Do When You Can't Find Any Docs {#troubleshoot}

**Check the Issues tab on GitHub.** Even when a plugin has no Wiki and a minimal README, the Issues tab is a goldmine. Users ask questions, developers answer them, and those answers are searchable. Search within Issues using GitHub's filter bar — type your problem in plain English.

**Check when the plugin was last updated.** On the GitHub repository page, look at the "Latest commit" date next to each file, or check the Releases section on the right sidebar. If the last release was two or more years ago and the Issues tab is full of unanswered questions, the plugin may be abandoned. At that point, look for a fork or an alternative plugin that does the same job.

**Watch YouTube tutorials.** Search `obsidian [plugin name] tutorial` on YouTube. Creators like Nicole van der Hoeven and Danny Hatcher produce detailed walkthroughs for popular plugins. Video tutorials are especially useful for visual, workflow-heavy plugins like Excalidraw or Canvas.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Finding Obsidian plugin documentation isn't complicated once you know the hierarchy: start in the app, follow the GitHub link, check for a README, look for a Wiki tab or dedicated site, then escalate to the community if you're still stuck. The common mistake is jumping straight to the forum before reading what the developer already wrote.

For users who want to move beyond hunting for plugin docs one at a time — and build a systematic, confident Obsidian workflow from the ground up — a structured course is worth the investment. [The Sweet Setup's "To Obsidian and Beyond" course](URL_PLACEHOLDER_10) walks through core and community plugins with the kind of depth that scattered forum posts never deliver. If you'd rather explore a broad library of options, [Udemy's Obsidian productivity courses](URL_PLACEHOLDER_11) regularly go on sale and cover everything from basic setup to advanced plugin stacking.

The documentation exists. Now you know exactly where to look.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why don't all Obsidian plugins have the same quality of documentation?

A: Community plugins are built by volunteers. Documentation quality directly reflects how much time the developer chose to invest in it. Popular plugins with large userbases tend to have better docs because user demand pressures developers to improve them.

### Q: The GitHub README mentions a feature I can't find in the plugin settings. What's happening?

A: Check the plugin version you have installed against the version on GitHub. An outdated plugin won't have features added after your version was released. Go to **Settings → Community plugins**, find the plugin, and check for an update.

### Q: How do I find the GitHub repository for a plugin I've already installed, without going back to the plugin browser?

A: Every installed plugin stores its data in your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/[plugin-id]/` folder. Open the `manifest.json` file — it contains an `authorUrl` or similar field that often links to GitHub. Faster path: just search the plugin name on GitHub directly.

### Q: Is the Obsidian Forum better than Reddit for finding plugin documentation help?

A: The official forum at `forum.obsidian.md` is better — it has proper tagging, a more active developer presence, and search that actually works. Reddit (`r/ObsidianMD`) is useful for casual questions but lacks the structure for tracking resolved issues.

### Q: What should I do if a plugin's documentation is outdated but the plugin still works?

A: Trust the plugin behavior over the docs. Open the plugin's Settings panel directly — most plugins document their options inline with descriptive labels. If that's not enough, look for recent posts on the forum or Issues tab where users discuss the current behavior.

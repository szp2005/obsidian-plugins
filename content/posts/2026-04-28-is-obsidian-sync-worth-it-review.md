# Is Obsidian Sync Worth It? An Honest, No-Nonsense Review (2024)

**TL;DR**
- Obsidian Sync costs $96/year and delivers end-to-end encrypted sync, 12-month version history, and cross-platform reliability that free alternatives consistently fail to match.
- Free options (iCloud, Git, Syncthing) all work — but each carries a real cost in setup time, maintenance, or platform restrictions that adds up fast.
- If you use Obsidian on two or more devices and your notes are genuinely important to you, Obsidian Sync is almost certainly worth it.

## 1. The Core Question: What Problem Does Obsidian Sync Solve? {#core-question}

Obsidian stores your notes as plain Markdown files on your local device. That's a feature, not a bug — your data is always yours, always readable, not locked in some proprietary format. But the moment you want to open your vault on a second device — say, your iPhone while you're away from your desk — you run into a wall. Obsidian itself has no built-in network layer.

The problem isn't "syncing files." Syncing files is technically easy. The problem is syncing them *reliably*, *securely*, and *without babysitting the process*, across every combination of Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android that your life might involve.

Obsidian Sync is the official answer. It runs on Obsidian's own infrastructure, it's maintained by the same team that builds the app, and it is designed specifically around how Obsidian works — particularly its use of hidden `.obsidian` folders for settings, plugins, and themes. That specificity matters a lot, as we'll see when we compare it to general-purpose tools.

## 2. Obsidian Sync's Killer Features: What Are You Paying For? {#killer-features}

### End-to-End Encryption

Every note, every attachment, every plugin configuration is encrypted on your device before it leaves. Obsidian's servers hold ciphertext they cannot read. The encryption key is derived from a password you set. If Obsidian gets hacked tomorrow, your notes are not exposed.

This is not the default behavior of Dropbox, iCloud, or Google Drive. Those services encrypt your files *in transit* and *at rest*, but they hold the keys — meaning they can read your content, and so can anyone who successfully compels them to hand it over. If your notes contain client information, therapy sessions, medical records, or anything else you'd call sensitive, that distinction is meaningful.

### Version History

The Standard plan gives you 1 month of version history; the Plus plan gives you 12 months. In practice, this means you can roll back any note to any previous state within that window.

Concrete scenario: You spend 45 minutes reorganizing a complex research note, decide you've made it worse, and want the original back. Without version history, you're hoping your operating system has a shadow copy. With Obsidian Sync, you open the note, click "Sync," hit "View version history," and restore the paragraph you deleted an hour ago. Done in 30 seconds.

### Selective Sync

You can configure which folders within a vault are synced to which devices. This means your 10GB folder of reference PDFs doesn't have to land on your phone. You can keep your daily notes synced everywhere while keeping your archived projects desktop-only. On mobile, where storage and bandwidth matter, this is a practical necessity rather than a luxury.

### Plugin, Theme, and Settings Sync

This is the one that most general-purpose sync tools get wrong. Obsidian's plugin configurations live inside `.obsidian/plugins/`, and syncing them incorrectly — for example, syncing a plugin state file while the plugin itself is mid-update — can corrupt your vault. Obsidian Sync understands the structure and handles it cleanly. You can toggle sync for core settings, themes, hotkeys, and active plugins independently.

## 3. Cost vs. Convenience: Head-to-Head with Free Alternatives {#cost-vs-convenience}

### Obsidian Sync vs. iCloud Drive

iCloud is the path of least resistance for Mac/iPhone users. Drop your vault in iCloud Drive, done. Except: iCloud has a documented habit of showing files as "downloaded" when they haven't fully synced, causing Obsidian to open an older version of a note and silently overwrite the newer one. It happens more on mobile, and it happens more under poor connectivity. The data loss isn't theoretical — you'll find dozens of firsthand reports in the Obsidian forum.

iCloud also has zero version history for individual files (Time Machine is desktop-only), no E2EE, and it simply does not work if any of your devices run Windows or Android.

### Obsidian Sync vs. Git

Git is the most powerful option for technically inclined users. You get full version history, complete portability, and no ongoing cost. The tradeoffs are real: Git has no concept of automatic commits. You need either a cron job, a Git plugin (like Obsidian Git), or manual discipline to actually commit changes. On mobile, the Obsidian Git plugin is functional but fragile — it breaks on some iOS updates, requires a personal access token setup that confuses non-developers, and does not handle merge conflicts gracefully when you forget to pull before editing.

If you're comfortable with the command line and you only sync to a second device you control, Git is excellent. If you share your workflow with a less technical partner, or if your mobile device is a primary writing tool, Git will cost you hours you don't want to spend.

### Obsidian Sync vs. Syncthing

[Syncthing](URL_PLACEHOLDER_1) is a free, open-source, peer-to-peer sync tool that many power users swear by. It works well, it's genuinely secure (TLS + device verification), and it has no cloud intermediary at all. The issue is that both devices must be online at the same time to sync, or you need to run a relay/always-on device to bridge them. Setting up Syncthing correctly takes 30–90 minutes even for experienced users, and it requires occasional maintenance — firewall rules, app updates, conflict resolution.

If you have a home server running 24/7 and you enjoy infrastructure, Syncthing is excellent. If you're evaluating tools to reduce friction in your workflow, adding a self-hosted relay to your stack is moving in the wrong direction.

## 4. Scoring Matrix: Obsidian Sync vs. The Alternatives {#scoring-matrix}

Scores out of 5. Higher is better.

| Factor | Obsidian Sync | iCloud Drive | Git | Syncthing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Setup Difficulty** (ease) | 5 | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| **Reliability** | 5 | 3 | 3 | 4 |
| **End-to-End Encryption** | 5 | 1 | 3* | 4 |
| **Cross-Platform Support** | 5 | 2 | 4 | 5 |
| **Version History** | 5 | 1 | 5 | 1 |
| **Ongoing Maintenance** (low = good) | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
| **Mobile Experience** | 5 | 3 | 2 | 3 |
| **Monthly Cost** | $8 | $0–$3 | $0 | $0 |
| **TOTAL (out of 35)** | **35** | **18** | **22** | **21** |

*Git encryption depends on whether you're pushing to a private repo on a trusted host. GitHub has access to your content unless you add a separate encryption layer.

## 5. Is the Price Tag Justified? A Real-World Cost Analysis {#price-analysis}

Obsidian Sync costs **$8/month or $96/year** for the Plus plan (1 year version history, 10GB storage, up to 4 remote vaults). There's a Standard plan at **$4/month** with 1-month history and 1GB storage — sufficient for text-only vaults.

To put $96/year in context: that's $1.85/week, roughly one coffee. It's 60% of a Netflix Standard subscription, and it protects data that is arguably more personal and irreplaceable than anything you stream.

The more honest calculation is time. If troubleshooting iCloud sync issues costs you 20 minutes per month (a conservative estimate based on forum activity), that's 4 hours per year. If your time is worth $25/hour, you're "paying" $100/year in aggravation anyway — and getting none of the E2EE or version history. At $30/hour, the math is even clearer.

Non-profit organizations and users in certain lower-income regions can apply for pricing adjustments directly through Obsidian's support. Students should check whether their institution has any arrangements, though there are none currently listed publicly.

If you want to support the Obsidian developers further, the [Obsidian Catalyst license](URL_PLACEHOLDER_2) is a one-time purchase that funds development and grants access to insider builds — it's not a substitute for Sync, but it's worth knowing about.

## 6. Who Should Absolutely Buy Obsidian Sync? {#who-should-buy}

**The Multi-Platform Professional.** You have a Windows work laptop, a personal MacBook, and an Android phone. No single free solution covers all three without friction. Obsidian Sync does, out of the box.

**The Security-Conscious User.** If your vault contains anything you'd consider sensitive — therapy notes, client work, medical information, personal finances — E2EE isn't optional. It's the baseline. Obsidian Sync and [Sync.com](URL_PLACEHOLDER_3) (for ancillary file storage) are among the few services that take this seriously at the consumer level. Speaking of which: if you care enough about E2EE to pay for it in your notes, it's worth extending that thinking to your whole internet connection with a trusted VPN like [NordVPN](URL_PLACEHOLDER_4).

**The Non-Tinkerer.** Your vault is your second brain. You've invested hundreds of hours building it. You do not want to debug a Syncthing relay on a Sunday afternoon. You want to open a note on your phone while you're waiting in line and have it just be there.

**Anyone for Whom Notes Are Mission-Critical.** Writers, researchers, consultants, anyone who loses real money or real work if their notes become inaccessible or corrupted. The version history alone is worth the subscription cost as insurance.

---

## 7. Who Should Stick with Free Options? {#who-should-skip}

**The Budget-Conscious Student or Hobbyist.** If $96/year is genuinely a stretch, and you only use one or two Apple devices, iCloud is workable. Save your money, accept the occasional sync headache, and revisit when your situation changes.

**The Single-Device User.** If you write on one machine and never need your notes elsewhere, you need no sync solution at all. Local backups to an external drive or [Sync.com](URL_PLACEHOLDER_3) cover your data safety needs for less.

**The Enthusiast Who Enjoys the Setup.** Git is genuinely powerful. If you want per-commit version history, full portability, and you like configuring tools, the Obsidian Git plugin plus a private GitHub repo is a legitimate, robust setup. You're not missing out — you're making a different tradeoff.

**Pure Apple Ecosystem Users with Low Sensitivity Data.** If every device you own is made by Apple, your notes are grocery lists and recipes, and you never travel with poor connectivity, iCloud is probably fine. The sync corruption issues are real but not universal.

## 8. First-Time Setup: Connecting Two Devices in Under 5 Minutes {#setup-guide}

Here's exactly what the process looks like. No prior configuration needed.

**Step 1: Purchase and activate**
Go to obsidian.md/sync, purchase a plan, and you'll receive a license key.

**Step 2: Enable Sync on Device 1 (Desktop)**
Open Obsidian → Settings → Core Plugins → Enable "Sync" → Click the Sync icon in the left ribbon.

**Step 3: Create a remote vault**
In the Sync panel, click "Create new vault." Name it, set an encryption password (write this down — Obsidian cannot recover it), and click "Create."

**Step 4: Connect your current local vault**
Click "Connect" next to your new remote vault. Choose "Use existing local vault" and confirm. Sync begins immediately.

**Step 5: Configure Selective Sync**
In Sync settings, you'll see toggles for: Attachments, Settings, Themes, Snippets, Plugins, Plugin settings. Disable "Attachments" on mobile if your attachment folder is large.

**Step 6: Connect Device 2 (e.g., iPhone)**
Install Obsidian mobile → Settings → Core Plugins → Enable Sync → Sign in with your Obsidian account → Find your remote vault → Enter the encryption password → Choose "Create new local vault" → Sync begins.

Total elapsed time for a typical vault: 3–5 minutes for the setup, plus sync time proportional to vault size. A 50MB text vault syncs in under a minute on Wi-Fi.

## 9. FAQ {#faq}

**Q: What's the storage limit on Obsidian Sync?**
The Standard plan includes 1GB of remote storage (ample for text-only vaults). The Plus plan includes 10GB, which covers most users who store PDFs and images alongside their notes. Storage counts the remote copy, not your local files.

**Q: Can I share my vault with another user through Obsidian Sync?**
Not directly through Sync. Vault sharing for collaboration is handled by Obsidian Publish, which is a separate product designed for publishing notes publicly or to invited readers. Obsidian Sync is single-user only.

**Q: Is Obsidian Sync faster than iCloud?**
In real-world use: yes, noticeably. Obsidian Sync pushes changes incrementally as you type (with a short delay), whereas iCloud syncs at the file level and sometimes batches updates. The practical difference shows most on mobile — Sync usually has your latest note ready by the time you unlock your phone.

**Q: What happens if I cancel Obsidian Sync?**
Your local vaults remain completely intact. You lose access to the remote vault and version history, but your notes on each device stay exactly as they were. You can immediately switch to any alternative sync method without data loss.

**Q: Is Obsidian Sync safe from the company shutting down?**
This is a legitimate concern with any SaaS. Obsidian is privately funded, profitable through individual licenses and Sync subscriptions, and has publicly committed to local-first principles. They've also published their data export format. That said, the smart habit is keeping regular local backups regardless of which sync solution you use.

## 10. Final Verdict {#final-verdict}

Obsidian Sync is not for everyone, and it doesn't try to be. It's a premium service priced to reflect real infrastructure, real encryption engineering, and a support team that answers sync questions specifically.

**Buy it if:** You use Obsidian on two or more devices, at least one of which isn't an Apple product; your notes contain anything sensitive; or you've already lost time to sync failures and you're done troubleshooting.

**Skip it if:** You're a single-device user, you're on a tight budget and all-Apple, or you genuinely enjoy running your own infrastructure.

The free alternatives are not bad. They're just tools with different tradeoffs. iCloud requires you to accept occasional data loss risk. Git requires you to accept a learning curve and mobile friction. Syncthing requires you to accept ongoing maintenance. Obsidian Sync asks you to accept a $96/year bill in exchange for eliminating all three of those problems.

For anyone whose Obsidian vault represents real, irreplaceable thinking, that's an easy trade.

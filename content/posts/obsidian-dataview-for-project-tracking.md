# Obsidian Dataview for Project Tracking: Complete Setup Guide

> **Quick Answer:** Obsidian Dataview for project tracking transforms your plain-text markdown vault into a dynamic, queryable database. By adding structured metadata (YAML or inline fields) to your notes, you can write simple DQL (Dataview Query Language) scripts to automatically aggregate tasks, track project statuses, and generate real-time dashboards across your entire workspace.

Managing projects in a plain-text environment often leads to a common breaking point. When you only have ten notes, folder structures and basic wiki-links work perfectly. When you scale to hundreds of notes, meeting minutes, and scattered to-do lists, retrieving actionable information becomes a manual, time-consuming process. Tasks slip through the cracks, and gaining a high-level overview of active projects feels impossible without maintaining separate, redundant tracking documents.

Obsidian Dataview bridges the gap between raw text files and structured project management systems. It allows you to maintain the friction-free writing experience of local markdown files while introducing the database capabilities you would typically expect from heavier tools like Notion or Jira. 

By defining standard metadata across your project files, Dataview can pull disparate pieces of information into automated lists, tables, and task boards. This guide covers the architectural setup, specific query structures, and practical implementation strategies required to build a resilient project tracking system entirely within Obsidian.

## The Foundations of Dataview for Project Management

Before writing complex queries, you must understand how Dataview interprets the text within your vault. Dataview does not read your mind; it reads specific data structures. To track projects effectively, you need a consistent taxonomy.

### How Dataview Treats Your Vault

Dataview indexes your Obsidian vault in the background. It treats every markdown file as a database record. The properties of that record are defined by the metadata you attach to the file. If a file has no metadata, Dataview only knows its title, creation date, modification date, and size. To track projects, we must inject custom properties.

### YAML Frontmatter vs. Inline Fields

There are two primary ways to feed data to Dataview: YAML frontmatter and inline fields. 

**YAML Frontmatter** sits at the very top of your markdown file enclosed in triple dashes. It is the most robust way to define file-level attributes like a project's status, deadline, or assigned team member.

```yaml
---
type: project
status: active
due: 2026-06-15
priority: high
client: Acme Corp
---
```

**Inline Fields** exist within the body of your notes. They are written using a double-colon syntax (`Key:: Value`). Inline fields are highly effective for logging data during meetings or daily notes without scrolling back to the top of the file.

```markdown
We discussed the marketing rollout today. 
next_milestone:: Finalize ad copy
milestone_date:: 2026-05-20
```

For a rigorous project tracking system, rely primarily on YAML frontmatter for file-level status and use inline fields for granular, context-specific data points.

## Essential Dataview Query Types for Tracking

Dataview Query Language (DQL) operates similarly to SQL. You define the presentation format, the data source, the filtering criteria, and the sorting mechanism.

### The Table Query for Project Overviews

The `TABLE` query is the workhorse of project tracking. It provides a spreadsheet-like view of your active initiatives. To monitor all active projects, you would structure a query to pull specific frontmatter fields from a designated folder.

```sql
TABLE status, due as "Deadline", priority
FROM "Projects"
WHERE status = "active"
SORT due ASC
```

This simple block searches the "Projects" folder, filters for notes where the YAML `status` is exactly "active", and generates a table displaying the note link, status, deadline, and priority, sorted by the closest upcoming deadline.

### The Task Query for Actionable Items

Standard Obsidian tasks (formatted as `- [ ] Task description`) are automatically indexed by Dataview. The `TASK` query aggregates these action items across multiple files, making it impossible to lose a to-do item buried in a random meeting note.

```sql
TASK
FROM "Projects" OR "Meetings"
WHERE !completed
AND due < date(today) + dur(7 days)
GROUP BY file.name
```

This query pulls uncompleted tasks from both your "Projects" and "Meetings" folders, specifically filtering for items due within the next seven days, and groups them by the note they originate from. This provides immediate context for the task.

### The List Query for Status Logs

The `LIST` query is useful for generating simple indexes, such as a log of recently completed projects or a list of specific deliverables.

```sql
LIST due
FROM "Projects"
WHERE status = "archived"
SORT file.mtime DESC
LIMIT 10
```

This outputs a clean bulleted list of the 10 most recently modified archived projects, alongside their original due dates.

## Step-by-Step: Building a Project Tracking Dashboard

A comprehensive system requires a central dashboard—a single Obsidian note acting as your control center. Here is how to architect it.

### Step 1: Standardizing Your Project Templates

Automated dashboards fail if the underlying data is inconsistent. Create an Obsidian template for all new projects to enforce metadata hygiene.

Your `Project Template.md` should include:

```yaml
---
type: project
status: backlog
start_date: 
due_date: 
tags: []
---
```

Whenever you spin up a new project, insert this template. The simple act of standardizing the `status` vocabulary (e.g., backlog, active, paused, completed) ensures your Dataview queries will catch every file.

### Step 2: Creating the Master Project Board

Create a new note titled `Dashboard.md`. This note will contain no raw text, only Dataview code blocks.

First, build the **Active Projects** module:

```sql
TABLE due_date as "Due", length(file.tasks.text) as "Total Tasks", length(filter(file.tasks.completed, (t) => t = true)) as "Completed Tasks"
FROM "Projects"
WHERE status = "active"
SORT due_date ASC
```

This advanced table not only lists the projects but dynamically calculates the total number of tasks inside each project note and how many are completed, giving you an automated progress metric without manual data entry.

### Step 3: Isolating Bottlenecks and Overdue Items

Beneath your active projects, add a module specifically designed to catch things falling behind schedule.

```sql
TASK
FROM "Projects"
WHERE !completed 
AND file.day < date(today)
GROUP BY status
```

This query identifies unfinished tasks residing in files created or designated before today, categorizing them by the project's overall status.

## Advanced Techniques for Complex Workflows

Once you master the basic `FROM` and `WHERE` clauses, Dataview offers powerful data manipulation tools for granular project tracking.

### Tracking Project Milestones with FLATTEN

Sometimes an array of data exists within a single file. For instance, if you have multiple milestones listed in a single project note's YAML:

```yaml
milestones:
  - Phase 1: Planning
  - Phase 2: Design
  - Phase 3: Deployment
```

A standard table will clump these together. Using the `FLATTEN` command separates list items into distinct rows in your dashboard.

```sql
TABLE milestone
FROM "Projects"
WHERE status = "active"
FLATTEN milestones as milestone
```

This generates a distinct row for every individual phase, allowing you to track granular deliverables across high-level projects.

### DataviewJS for Custom Visualizations

If DQL reaches its limits, Dataview provides a full JavaScript API (`dataviewjs`). This allows you to write actual code to process your vault data. For example, rendering a progress bar for a project requires DataviewJS.

While the exact JavaScript syntax is beyond the scope of a basic setup, utilizing `dv.pages("Projects")` allows you to iterate through your project files and use HTML/CSS to render visual elements like progress trackers and warning indicators based on task completion percentages.

## Practical Setup Advice and Limitations

Implementing Obsidian Dataview for project tracking requires discipline. The software is highly capable, but user error in data entry is the primary cause of broken dashboards. 

1. **Limit query scopes for performance:** Running `FROM ""` searches your entire vault. If you have 10,000 notes, this will cause noticeable lag every time you open your dashboard. Always restrict Dataview queries to specific directories (e.g., `FROM "Projects/Active"`) or specific tags (`FROM #project`).
2. **Standardize date formats:** Dataview expects ISO 8601 formatting for dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`). If you write `May 1st, 2026` in your metadata, Dataview will treat it as a plain string, breaking your date-based filtering and sorting algorithms.
3. **Keep metadata simple:** Do not create twenty YAML properties for a project. Track only what you actually need to query. Status, deadline, priority, and area/client are usually sufficient. Redundant metadata creates friction, making you less likely to maintain the system over time.
4. **Remember that Dataview is read-only:** You cannot click a checkbox inside a Dataview `TABLE` to mark a project complete. You must navigate to the original file to change the YAML. For task lists, clicking a checkbox in a `TASK` query *will* alter the original file, which is a vital workflow efficiency.

## Building Your Permanent Tracking System

Shifting your project tracking entirely into plain text safeguards your data against proprietary lock-in. By leveraging standard metadata and Dataview's highly customizable queries, you maintain absolute control over how your work is visualized. Start with a single table tracking active files, enforce a strict YAML template, and slowly introduce task aggregation and dynamic sorting as your workflow demands. 

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Dataview work on Obsidian mobile?
Yes. Dataview queries execute locally on your device. Whether you are using iOS or Android, your project dashboards will render correctly, provided the files are synced to your mobile vault.

### Will Dataview slow down my Obsidian vault?
It can, depending on the complexity of your queries and the size of your vault. Performance issues typically arise when users query their entire vault instead of narrowing the search using specific folders or tags. Keep your `FROM` statements targeted.

### Can I edit data directly inside a Dataview table?
No, natively Dataview produces read-only views of your metadata. To alter a project's status, you must click into the source file. However, community plugins like Metadata Menu can be layered over Dataview to enable inline editing from tables.

### What is the difference between Dataview and Obsidian Projects?
Dataview is a query engine that uses code blocks to display data in standard formats. The Obsidian Projects plugin is a visual interface layer (often built on top of Dataview data) that provides Kanban boards, calendar views, and gallery views without requiring you to write DQL code.

### Are Dataview queries future-proof?
The queries themselves are specific to the Dataview plugin. However, the data powering the queries (your markdown tasks and YAML frontmatter) is universal. If Dataview ever ceases to exist, your raw data remains perfectly intact and accessible by any other text parser.

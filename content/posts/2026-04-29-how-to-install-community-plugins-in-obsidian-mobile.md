# How to Install Community Plugins in Obsidian Mobile (iOS & Android)

**TL;DR**
- You must disable Restricted Mode in Obsidian's mobile settings before any community plugin can be installed — this is the step most beginners miss.
- Not every desktop plugin works on mobile; always check the plugin's GitHub page or community reviews before installing.
- If your plugins or settings aren't syncing between devices, Obsidian Sync is the most reliable fix — iCloud and third-party sync tools often cause partial or broken states.

## Why Use Community Plugins on Obsidian Mobile? {#why-use}

Community plugins are third-party extensions built by Obsidian users and developers. They live outside the core app and do things the official build won't: custom toolbars, quick-capture workflows, spaced repetition, task management integrations, and dozens of other functions.

On desktop, installing them is a well-documented routine. On mobile, the same capability exists — but the path through the UI is slightly different, fewer people document it properly, and some plugins genuinely do not behave on a 6-inch screen.

Here's why it's still worth doing:

- **Custom toolbars.** Mobile keyboards hide your formatting shortcuts. Plugins like Commander let you put the commands you actually use front and center.
- **Quick capture.** You're on your phone because something just happened. Plugins like QuickAdd let you log a thought in two taps without derailing your whole vault.
- **Workflow continuity.** If you're already running plugins on desktop, getting the same ones running on mobile means your notes, templates, and automation behave consistently.

The caveat: a plugin marked "mobile-compatible" by its developer may still have UI elements that are too small to tap, break the reading pane, or quietly fail on iOS but work fine on Android. You will need to test.

## The Critical First Step: Disabling Restricted Mode {#restricted-mode}

By default, Obsidian ships with **Restricted Mode** turned on. This blocks all community plugins from running. It exists for a real reason: plugins execute arbitrary code on your device. Obsidian's core team reviews plugins for obvious malware before listing them, but they cannot audit every line of every update.

**To disable Restricted Mode on mobile:**

1. Open Obsidian and tap the **three-line menu** (hamburger) in the bottom-left corner.
2. Tap **Settings** (the gear icon).
3. Scroll down to **Community plugins** in the left sidebar.
4. Tap **Community plugins**.
5. Tap **Turn on community plugins**.
6. Read the warning prompt, then tap **Turn on** to confirm.

That's it. The setting looks identical on iOS and Android.

> ⚠️ **Security note:** Only install plugins from the official Obsidian plugin browser, which lists plugins that have passed at least a basic review. Before installing anything, spend 30 seconds on its GitHub page. Look for: recent commits (updated within the last 6 months), a reasonable star count, and an active issue tracker. A plugin last touched in 2021 with 12 stars and no responses to issues is not worth the risk on a device you use for sensitive notes.

## How to Install a Community Plugin on Mobile (Step-by-Step) {#install-steps}

Once Restricted Mode is off, the installation process is straightforward.

1. Go to **Settings > Community plugins**.
2. Tap **Browse** — this opens the plugin directory inside the app.
3. Use the **search bar** at the top to find the plugin by name or keyword.
4. Tap the plugin name to open its detail page.
5. Tap **Install**.
6. After installation completes, tap **Enable**.

The plugin is now active. Some plugins add a settings panel under **Settings > [Plugin Name]** — configure it there before expecting anything to work.

**One common mistake:** People install a plugin and wonder why nothing changed. The install step downloads the files; the enable step actually runs it. Both are required, every time.

## Finding Plugins That Actually Work on Mobile {#finding-plugins}

The plugin browser doesn't filter by mobile compatibility. You have to do that research yourself.

**Practical ways to vet a plugin for mobile:**

- Search the [Obsidian community forum](https://forum.obsidian.md) for the plugin name + "mobile." Real user reports are more reliable than developer claims.
- On the plugin's GitHub page, check the README for any mention of iOS or Android. If mobile isn't mentioned at all, treat it as untested.
- Check the GitHub Issues tab for open bugs tagged "mobile" or "iOS/Android."
- In the plugin browser search, try terms like "mobile," "toolbar," or "capture" — developers who build for mobile tend to use those words in their descriptions.

**For advanced users: BRAT**

[BRAT (Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tool)](URL_PLACEHOLDER_1) is a plugin that lets you install plugins directly from a GitHub repository URL — including beta versions not yet in the official directory. On mobile, you install BRAT itself through the normal browser, then use it to add unlisted plugins by pasting a GitHub link.

This is useful for testing a plugin that claims to have a mobile fix in beta but hasn't pushed an official release. It adds risk, since beta code is less vetted. Don't use BRAT to install plugins from developers you haven't researched.

## Managing Your Mobile Plugins {#managing-plugins}

**Updating plugins:** Go to **Settings > Community plugins** and scroll to the **Installed plugins** section. If updates are available, you'll see an **Update** button next to the plugin name. Tap it. You can also tap **Check for updates** to force a refresh.

**Disabling without uninstalling:** Toggle the switch next to any plugin name. The plugin files stay installed but stop running. Useful for diagnosing conflicts — if something breaks, disable plugins one at a time to isolate the cause.

**Uninstalling:** Tap the plugin name, then tap **Uninstall**. This removes the files from your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` folder.

## Troubleshooting Common Mobile Plugin Issues {#troubleshooting}

**Plugins not showing up after installation**

This almost always means the enable step was skipped. Go back to **Settings > Community plugins > Installed plugins** and confirm the toggle is on. If the plugin is listed as enabled but still not working, try closing and reopening Obsidian entirely.

**Plugin settings not syncing between devices**

Plugin settings are stored in `.obsidian/plugins/[plugin-name]/data.json`. If your sync solution isn't copying that file between devices, your settings won't transfer.

[Obsidian Sync](URL_PLACEHOLDER_2) is the most reliable option here. It explicitly syncs vault configuration files, including plugin data, and handles conflicts gracefully. If you're relying on iCloud or Dropbox, those services sometimes lock files, skip hidden folders starting with `.`, or create sync conflicts that corrupt the data.json file silently. The symptom is usually a plugin that appears enabled on mobile but behaves as if freshly installed with no configuration.

If you're not ready to pay for Obsidian Sync, manually copy your `data.json` files via Files (iOS) or a file manager (Android) after making configuration changes on desktop.

**Plugin UI broken or unusable on small screens**

Some plugins inject custom HTML that assumes a wide viewport. If buttons are cut off or panels overflow the screen, try these fixes in order:

1. Check the plugin's GitHub issues for a reported mobile CSS fix.
2. Look for a CSS snippet in the Obsidian community forum that corrects the layout — paste it into **Settings > Appearance > CSS snippets**.
3. Contact the developer directly via GitHub issues. Most respond.
4. If the plugin is a toolbar or panel tool, check whether there's a mobile-specific alternative that does the same job.

## Top 5 Recommended Plugins for Your Mobile Vault {#top-plugins}

| Plugin | What It Solves | Mobile Compatibility |
|---|---|---|
| [Commander](URL_PLACEHOLDER_3) | Adds custom buttons to the mobile toolbar | Excellent — built with mobile in mind |
| [QuickAdd](URL_PLACEHOLDER_4) | Fast capture: append text, create notes from templates | Excellent — minimal UI, works great on small screens |
| [Advanced Mobile Toolbar](URL_PLACEHOLDER_5) | Expands the editing toolbar with more formatting options | Good — designed specifically for mobile |
| [Dataview](URL_PLACEHOLDER_6) | Query-based note views | Good — renders on mobile, editing queries is awkward |
| [Templater](URL_PLACEHOLDER_7) | Runs template logic on note creation | Good — configure on desktop, use on mobile |

**Commander** is the first plugin most mobile Obsidian users should install. The default mobile toolbar is limited. Commander lets you add, remove, and reorder buttons for any command in Obsidian — so your most-used actions are one tap away instead of buried in a menu.

**QuickAdd** earns its place because quick capture is the number one reason people open Obsidian on their phone. Set up a "Capture" macro on desktop once, and it becomes available on mobile immediately.

**Advanced Mobile Toolbar** fills the gap between Commander (which places commands in the toolbar) and the formatting options you'd normally access via keyboard shortcuts. If you write longform notes on mobile, this saves significant friction.

**Dataview** renders fine on mobile but writing queries on a phone is painful. Set up your dashboards on desktop; use mobile to read the output.

**Templater** follows the same logic — configure complex templates on desktop, trigger them cleanly on mobile.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Installing community plugins on Obsidian mobile is a five-minute process once you know where the controls are. The real work is choosing plugins that hold up on a small screen, making sure your sync setup actually propagates your settings, and knowing what to do when something breaks.

Start simple: disable Restricted Mode, install Commander and QuickAdd, and see how they change your daily capture routine. Add more plugins only when you have a specific problem they solve.

If syncing settings across devices is causing you headaches, [Obsidian Sync](URL_PLACEHOLDER_2) removes that entire category of problems and is the official, tested solution — worth considering if you rely on Obsidian seriously across multiple devices.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is it safe to install community plugins on Obsidian mobile?

Plugins in the official browser have passed a basic security review, but that review isn't exhaustive. Stick to plugins with recent updates, active maintainers, and community adoption. Don't install plugins from outside the official browser without understanding what you're doing.

### Q: Why don't my desktop plugins appear on mobile?

Plugins must be installed separately on each device. If you use Obsidian Sync with the "sync plugins" option enabled, installed plugins and their enabled/disabled state will transfer — but you still need to make sure the sync has completed before expecting them to appear.

### Q: Can I install plugins on Obsidian mobile without a computer?

Yes. The entire process — disabling Restricted Mode, browsing, installing, enabling — happens inside the mobile app. No desktop required.

### Q: What is Restricted Mode and do I need to keep it off permanently?

Restricted Mode blocks all community plugins. Once you turn it off, it stays off until you manually re-enable it. You do not need to toggle it each session. Re-enable it only if you want to return to a plugins-free, lower-risk state.

### Q: Why is a plugin working on Android but not iOS (or vice versa)?

iOS and Android use different rendering engines and file system permissions. Some plugins use APIs that behave differently on each platform. Check the plugin's GitHub issues for platform-specific bug reports, and test on both devices before relying on a plugin in your core workflow.

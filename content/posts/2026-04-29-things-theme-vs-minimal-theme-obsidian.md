# Things Theme vs Minimal Theme Obsidian: The Definitive Head-to-Head Comparison

---

## TL;DR

- **Things theme** is an opinionated, GTD-ready skin inspired by the Things 3 app — install it and your vault looks polished in five minutes, no tinkering required.
- **Minimal theme** is a near-blank canvas with deep Style Settings integration — ideal if you want granular control over typography, color, and layout.
- **Neither is universally better**: your workflow, not aesthetics, should drive the decision.

## 1. Beyond Default — Choosing Your Ideal Obsidian Interface {#introduction}

Obsidian's default theme is functional. It is also, frankly, forgettable. For an app you open dozens of times a day, that matters. Themes aren't cosmetic extras — they affect reading speed, cognitive load, and how naturally your workflow maps onto the screen.

Two themes dominate the conversation in every Obsidian community thread: **Things** and **Minimal**. They sit at opposite ends of a spectrum. Things arrives with a personality already baked in — warm tones, structured hierarchy, a clear nod to task management. Minimal arrives as a near-invisible framework that bends to whatever you want it to be.

Choosing wrong wastes hours. You set up a system, tweak CSS, build templates — then realize the theme fights your actual habits. This article gives you a concrete, side-by-side picture of both so you can decide in one read.

## 2. At a Glance: Things vs. Minimal Comparison Table {#comparison-table}

| Feature | Things Theme | Minimal Theme |
|---|---|---|
| **Design Philosophy** | Opinionated, productivity-first, GTD-aligned | Neutral canvas, low-contrast, typography-forward |
| **Customization Level** | Low-to-moderate (focused CSS variables) | Very high (100+ Style Settings options) |
| **Ideal User** | GTD practitioners, task-heavy workflows | Writers, researchers, power tinkerers |
| **Style Settings Integration** | Basic support | Deep, first-class integration |
| **Dataview Support** | Adequate, unstyled tables | Styled tables, cards, lists out of the box |
| **Kanban Plugin Styling** | Minimal, no special treatment | Optional card styles via helper classes |
| **Mobile Experience** | Clean, readable, limited adjustments | Responsive with mobile-specific settings |
| **Color Schemes Built-in** | 1 (light + dark variant) | 15+ presets (Atom, Solarized, Dracula, etc.) |
| **Helper / Utility Classes** | Few (checkbox icons, header styles) | Extensive (columns, cards, image grids, wide pages) |
| **Learning Curve** | Low — works immediately | Moderate — full power needs plugin setup |
| **Active Maintenance** | Community-maintained, slower updates | Actively maintained by @kepano |
| **CSS Snippet Compatibility** | Good | Excellent, well-documented variables |

## 3. Deep Dive: The Things Theme — Structure and Productivity {#things-theme}

[The Things theme](URL_PLACEHOLDER_1) was built by Colin Eckert specifically to mirror the visual language of [Things 3](URL_PLACEHOLDER_2), Cultured Code's task manager for Mac and iOS. If you use Things 3 for task capture and Obsidian for notes, the two apps start to feel like a single system.

### What It Actually Looks Like

The palette leans warm — off-white backgrounds in light mode, deep charcoal in dark. H1 through H3 headers have distinct sizing and weight that create a clear reading hierarchy without you touching a single setting. Horizontal rules render as subtle dividers rather than hard lines, which keeps long project notes scannable.

### GTD Elements Built Right In

The standout feature is **custom checkbox styling**. Things ships with a set of alternate checkbox types that map directly to GTD task states:

- `- [/]` → In Progress (half-filled circle)
- `- [-]` → Cancelled (strikethrough)
- `- [>]` → Deferred (arrow)
- `- [?]` → Question / Waiting For
- `- [!]` → Important

This alone is worth the install if you run any kind of action-list workflow in Obsidian. No CSS snippet required. No plugin. Just markdown.

### The Trade-Off: Opinionated Means Inflexible

That warm aesthetic is deliberate — and stubborn. Changing the accent color requires editing raw CSS variables. There is no GUI configuration panel comparable to what Minimal offers. For users who want a ready-made, good-looking system they never need to touch again, that's a feature. For anyone who wants to iterate on their setup seasonally or per project, it becomes a friction point.

Plugin support is adequate but not curated. Dataview tables render correctly but without any custom styling. Kanban boards are usable but plain. Calendar and Tasks plugins work, but neither gets special visual treatment.

## 4. Deep Dive: The Minimal Theme — A Canvas for Focus {#minimal-theme}

[Minimal](URL_PLACEHOLDER_3) is maintained by Stephan Ango (@kepano), who is also a co-founder of Obsidian. That proximity to the core team shows in how well the theme tracks with every major app update. It has been the most-downloaded community theme for years running, and the ecosystem around it reflects that longevity.

### Design Philosophy: Get Out of the Way

The design intention is explicit in the documentation: remove everything that doesn't directly serve reading or writing. Borders are thinner. Sidebar contrast is reduced. The editor surface feels like a sheet of paper. This isn't lazy design — it's deliberate reduction that drops cognitive load for sustained writing sessions.

### Style Settings Integration: 100+ Knobs

Install the [Style Settings plugin](URL_PLACEHOLDER_4) alongside Minimal and you unlock a dedicated settings panel covering:

- **Color schemes**: 15+ presets including Atom, Solarized, Gruvbox, Rosé Pine, Dracula
- **Font stacks**: Separate controls for UI font, body text, monospace, and headings
- **Line width**: Readable (660px), Wide (860px), or Max (full-width)
- **Image alignment**: Left, center, right, cover
- **Table styling**: Dense, minimal, or card-based rows
- **Sidebar behavior**: Collapsed borders, hidden UI chrome

None of this requires you to write a single line of CSS. It is the most complete theming system in the Obsidian ecosystem short of writing a theme yourself.

### Helper Classes: The Hidden Power Feature

Minimal ships with a set of **CSS helper classes** you add directly to note properties. Examples:

- `cssclasses: wide-page` → removes line-length limit for spreadsheet-style notes
- `cssclasses: cards` → transforms Dataview query results into a visual card grid
- `cssclasses: image-grid` → tiles embedded images into a gallery layout
- `cssclasses: column-list` → splits note content into newspaper-style columns

These classes make individual notes look categorically different from one another — a feature with real workflow implications for dashboards, MOCs, and reference libraries.

## 5. Customization Showdown: Style Settings vs. Opinionated Design {#customization}

If you hate touching CSS, **Things wins by default**. Install it, switch between light and dark with the standard toggle, use the built-in checkbox types, and you're done. The theme handles the design decisions so you don't have to.

If you want control, **Minimal is not even close competition**. The Style Settings panel covers typography, spacing, color, plugin UI, sidebar chrome, and per-note layout — all through a GUI. You could spend an afternoon building exactly the visual environment you want and never open a code editor.

### CSS Snippets

Both themes support raw CSS snippets, but Minimal's documentation explicitly lists its CSS variable names, making targeted tweaks straightforward. Things uses a smaller set of undocumented variables, so custom CSS is more trial-and-error.

**Recommended snippet workflow for Things:**
1. Install the [Minimal Things CSS snippet](URL_PLACEHOLDER_5) from the community — it bridges some gaps.
2. Override `--color-base-00` through `--color-base-100` to shift the warm palette toward cooler tones if preferred.

**Recommended workflow for Minimal:**
1. Install Style Settings first — without it, Minimal looks incomplete.
2. Pick a base color scheme, then adjust typography.
3. Add per-note `cssclasses` to dashboards and reference notes.

## 6. Workflow in Action: Writing vs. Managing a Project {#workflow}

### Use Case 1: Writing a Long-Form Article in Minimal

Open a blank note, set `cssclasses: wide-page` for drafting, then remove it when you want the 660px reading width during editing. Set a serif body font (Palatino or iA Writer Quattro both work cleanly) through Style Settings. Enable "Readable line length" in Obsidian's editor settings.

The result: a focused writing surface with no competing UI elements. The sidebar contrast drops low enough that you stop noticing it during deep work sessions. For writers building a PKM around long-form content, this environment is genuinely different from any other Obsidian configuration — and it's the kind of system a well-structured [PKM course](URL_PLACEHOLDER_6) would walk you through end-to-end.

### Use Case 2: Managing a Project with Things Theme

Create a project note with a clear H1 title, H2 sections for each phase, and H3 for subtasks. Use the custom checkbox types throughout: `- [/]` for active work, `- [>]` for items blocked on others, `- [!]` for blockers.

The warm header hierarchy makes the note scannable at a glance. The deferred and cancelled checkbox states mean your task list reflects actual GTD state, not just binary done/not-done. If you also use [Things 3](URL_PLACEHOLDER_2) for daily task management, the visual continuity between apps reduces context-switching friction in a measurable way.

## 7. Three User Personas — Who Should Pick What {#personas}

### The Minimalist Writer

**Profile:** Uses Obsidian primarily as a writing environment. Stores drafts, research notes, and published archives. Cares about line length, font rendering, and focus mode. Rarely uses Kanban or Dataview.

**Recommendation: Minimal.** The typography controls and distraction-free surface are purpose-built for this workflow. No other popular theme matches its reading and writing ergonomics.

### The GTD Power-User

**Profile:** Obsidian is a full task and project management system. Uses custom checkboxes, project templates, weekly review notes, and area/project/resource/archive folder structure. Loves the Things 3 aesthetic.

**Recommendation: Things.** The custom checkbox types alone justify the choice. The warm, structured design reinforces the GTD mental model every time the vault opens.

### The Aesthetic Tinkerer

**Profile:** Enjoys the process of customizing the tool as much as using it. Has CSS snippets, tries new color schemes, builds custom dashboards with Dataview card views. Wants maximum flexibility without forking a theme.

**Recommendation: Minimal.** The 100+ Style Settings options, helper classes, and well-documented variables provide more configuration surface than any other mainstream Obsidian theme. It won't run out of knobs to turn.

## 8. The Verdict: Which Obsidian Theme Is Right for You? {#verdict}

**Choose Things if:**
- You run GTD or any checklist-heavy workflow and want those task states without writing CSS
- You use Things 3 alongside Obsidian and want visual continuity
- You want a complete, polished look with zero configuration time

**Choose Minimal if:**
- Writing is your primary Obsidian activity
- You want fine-grained control over every visual variable
- You use Dataview heavily and want styled card/table outputs
- You plan to maintain and evolve your vault setup over time
- You need a reliable mobile experience with theme-specific adjustments

One practical note on mobile: if you use Obsidian across desktop and phone, theme consistency matters. [Obsidian Sync](URL_PLACEHOLDER_7) carries your theme settings and CSS snippets across devices, so whichever theme you choose looks identical on every platform — worth the subscription if your workflow spans devices.

Both themes are free. Both are production-quality. There is no wrong answer — only the wrong theme for your specific habits.

## Conclusion

The Things vs. Minimal debate in Obsidian isn't really about looks. It's about whether you want a theme that makes decisions for you (Things) or one that executes your decisions with precision (Minimal).

Pick Things, open your vault, start working. Pick Minimal, spend twenty minutes in Style Settings, then open your vault and start working. Either path leads to a significantly better daily experience than the default theme delivers.

If you're building a serious PKM practice, aesthetics are the easy part. System, habit, and workflow come first — and [a structured Obsidian course](URL_PLACEHOLDER_6) can accelerate that by months. Pair whichever theme you choose with [Obsidian Sync](URL_PLACEHOLDER_7) to keep it consistent across every device, and your setup becomes something you actually look forward to opening each morning.

That's the real goal.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use both Things and Minimal at the same time in Obsidian?

No. Obsidian loads one active theme at a time. However, you can switch between them instantly via Settings → Appearance. Some users maintain separate vault profiles with different themes for different projects, which is a legitimate workaround.

### Does Things theme work without the Style Settings plugin?

Yes, and unlike Minimal, it works well without it. Things ships as a complete visual system. Style Settings adds some minor options but is not required for the full experience.

### Will either theme break when Obsidian updates?

Minimal is maintained by an Obsidian co-founder and updates quickly after major app releases. Things is community-maintained with a slower update cadence — check the [GitHub repository](URL_PLACEHOLDER_1) for the last commit date before relying on it for a production vault.

### Which theme performs better on mobile?

Minimal has explicit mobile-specific settings in Style Settings, including touch target sizes and sidebar behavior. Things renders cleanly on mobile but offers no mobile-specific configuration options.

### Are there themes that combine elements of both Things and Minimal?

Yes. AnuPpuccin offers customizable color schemes with built-in alternate checkbox styling — it sits somewhere between the two in terms of flexibility vs. out-of-the-box completeness. Ebullient and Border themes also draw from both design languages and are worth exploring if neither Things nor Minimal clicks.
